1,i flew from amsterdam to las vegas with a layover in heathrow in november 2024 the day we were flying the weather wasnt great since i was on business i really needed to get to las vegas we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving we would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to heathrow or even take the train when we checked according to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection according to the staff of british airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic when we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection an hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasnt there yet and we would have a major delay we called customer service and they told us to just go to london and see from there we wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those in the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced british airways to book that for us even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers this resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip on our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate on the way back we tried to check in through the online portal my colleague was able to check in just fine but i couldnt i was afraid i was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times  when i got to the airport i was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online since we were seated in premium economy i could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane when we got to london our flight back to amsterdam was delayed this was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off it took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin  when we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to amsterdam arriving in amsterdam they had left my luggage in las vegas so i needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me afterwards i have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs its been almost 3 months and they still havent replied every time i contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them,490,0.03758417508417509,positive,-0.8095,negative,"['flew', 'amsterdam', 'las', 'vegas', 'layover', 'heathrow', 'november', 'day', 'flying', 'weather', 'wasnt', 'great', 'since', 'business', 'really', 'needed', 'get', 'las', 'vegas', 'anticipated', 'checked', 'early', 'flight', 'still', 'leaving', 'would', 'ample', 'time', 'catch', 'earlier', 'flight', 'heathrow', 'even', 'take', 'train', 'checked', 'according', 'google', 'flight', 'delayed', 'would', 'miss', 'connection', 'according', 'staff', 'british', 'airways', 'flight', 'delayed', 'reason', 'panic', 'got', 'airport', 'still', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'connection', 'hour', 'supposed', 'leave', 'announced', 'plane', 'wasnt', 'yet', 'would', 'major', 'delay', 'called', 'customer', 'service', 'told', 'us', 'go', 'london', 'see', 'wanted', 'kind', 'assurance', 'could', 'placed', 'hotel', 'since', 'would', 'making', 'connecting', 'flight', 'refused', 'give', 'end', 'found', 'direct', 'flight', 'next', 'day', 'convinced', 'british', 'airways', 'book', 'us', 'even', 'though', 'wanted', 'connect', 'us', 'additional', 'layovers', 'resulted', 'approximately', 'hour', 'delay', 'trip', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'lost', 'luggage', 'gate', 'took', 'approximately', 'hours', 'find', 'wrong', 'gate', 'way', 'back', 'tried', 'check', 'online', 'portal', 'colleague', 'able', 'check', 'fine', 'couldnt', 'afraid', 'overbooked', 'contacted', 'customer', 'service', 'times', 'got', 'airport', 'overbooked', 'ground', 'staff', 'nerve', 'tell', 'fault', 'checking', 'online', 'since', 'seated', 'premium', 'economy', 'could', 'moved', 'regular', 'economy', 'mean', 'someone', 'economy', 'bumped', 'plane', 'got', 'london', 'flight', 'back', 'amsterdam', 'delayed', 'disabled', 'people', 'board', 'plane', 'still', 'enough', 'wheelchairs', 'get', 'took', 'approximately', 'hours', 'boarding', 'could', 'begin', 'finally', 'boarded', 'told', 'needed', 'new', 'pilot', 'old', 'pilot', 'made', 'many', 'hours', 'waiting', 'around', 'still', 'fly', 'us', 'amsterdam', 'arriving', 'amsterdam', 'left', 'luggage', 'las', 'vegas', 'needed', 'wait', 'another', 'week', 'given', 'back', 'afterwards', 'made', 'claim', 'soon', 'possible', 'delays', 'hotel', 'costs', 'almost', 'months', 'still', 'havent', 'replied', 'every', 'time', 'contact', 'claim', 'huge', 'backlog', 'takes', 'long', 'process']"

12,i left for london from johannesburg at 2115 on 22 december 2024 my only issue with that flight was the pillows they gave us were dirty and when my 7 year old dropped some juice and i asked a cabin crew member walking past for some serviettes she told me to go to the bathroom to get some to clean it up those issues werent pleasant but certainly not a major problem i was booked on the ba0057 at 2115 on 31 december 2024 to return to johannesburg the flight was delayed to the 1 january 2025 at 1200pm i had a connecting flight to durban and do not live in johannesburg landing in johannesburg with 3 children at 1 am was not an option for me ba changed my flight to 2nd january 2025 at 1825 i requested a sooner date so i could get home sooner i was given 1 january 2025 at 2115 i accepted this as this is the original time i opted for and would he most convenient for me as i was doing a connection in johannesburg to durban unfortunately this flight was delayed till 2nd january at 1700 i was extremely upset by this as i was absolutely exhausted and had 3 children who were absolutely exhausted i also suffer from eczema and hay fever and did not have my creams and medication this caused my eczema to flare up so badly even my lips were cracked and burning my allergies were so severe that my eyes were sticking together and i couldnt stop sneezing my daughter also has eczema and has had a flare up the staff had no sympathy or empathy for a mother traveling alone and her children i was just told that they know its an inconvenience and a lady even snapped at me that they trying their best my children are 4 7 and 11 and we were all booked on separate seats is that even legal let alone ethical they were refusing to help me and saying they cant do anything i approached 3 people and the third person finally put us together so they could clearly help me my flight from johannesburg to durban was originally booked on south african airways and i paid a lot for this ticket as south african airways is not a low cost airline i was given a cheap low cost airline cemair which i had never even heard of to replace my saa flight i suffer from flight anxiety and this is why i never book low cost airlines with tiny flights my anxiety went through the roof on the flight besides all of this i am also left with a huge credit card bill as i used up all my pounds on the 1st i know ba is obliged to compensate me for the inconvenience under eu law but besides the compensation ba staff really needs to show more empathy for their passengers like me who had two hours long flight delays two days in a row and was alone with 3 children i expect my full compensation for all of us as this has been by far the worst experience i have had traveling all their staff kept saying is thats why you will get compensation i am now waiting to see if i get compensated as i was promised by all of their ground staff legally they have to under eu law so lets see if they put up a fight or do what is

36,i decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to world traveller plus on the return leg of our canada holiday paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work i hadnt bought a book or uploaded a film because i had assumed i would be enjoying the entertainment ba had promised so i decided to lie back and get some rest instead only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didnt work the flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent when i had to keep my seatback upright leaving me with back pain that lasted three days i have a bad lower back early on in this experience i asked to be moved to economy so that i could sit normally and watch a film but the flight was full and there was no space the apologetic flight attendant assured me i would receive compensation which i assumed meant the airline would at the very least upgrade us the next time we flew ba since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of world traveller plus the two of us only had one suitcase each so hadnt made use of the extra baggage allowance bas actual compensation offer 25 worth of avios points each i wrote back since ba doesnt allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable given the hundreds of extra pounds id paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver they then ghosted me my experience is a cautionary tale about british airways customer support if all goes to plan you may well have a very pleasant world traveller plus experience but if anything should go wrong support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted so unless youre prepared to gamble i would advise you to either stick with economyworld traveller since then youre only really paying to fly from a to b which they do manage to do or fly with another airline or you could end up like me throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class if your flight is to canada i would recommend an airline such as air canada which i turned to during the uncertainty of the covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast nononsense refunds they do cost a bit more so when life returned to normal postcovid i started flying ba again believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important i now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy  one that

being resolved and false information due to no longer being able to fly for my original flight i called and spoke to someone who gave me a new reference number where i could book at a later datedestination or change the name i then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which i then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral as i was told i could change the name when then calling and trying to do this i then got told that i was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the policy after questioning this and not wanting to get false information i made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did after then troubling my aunt and uncle who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son my cousin for this documentation we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name to which we then found out was yet another lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change after expressing my feelings of mistrust that i would be taking it further as i no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company i was told that i wasnt allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date i then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which i was told they had none working they had gone home and that no one had any direct email after then putting in a formal complaint 5 months ago with still no response i called back to use the money to book a new flight to say i couldnt as it was a less amount even after saying fine keep the remaining money and i was only allowed to book the same amount or more scam to get more money out of you when asking to speak to a manager shock horror there isnt one working when looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months to then be told there is nothing he can do i am beyond appalled hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till i speak to someone who genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreementresolve the issue as the information i was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesnt care at all about its customers and only cares about money and

90,i travelled london to doha on july 16th i had to physically check in at ba business t5 because i had an ongoing connection in doha and the flight was a code share with qatar i had paid for my flight through qatar and paid for the seat online so i could sit where i like to sit and when i got to check in discovered i had been reseated elsewhere in the cabin and was told that was their policy and basically to shut up about it i then discovered that ba do not recognise qatar frequent flyer rules despite sharing avios points im a gold card holder in qatar which affords me extra kilos on the baggage but ba tried to tell me i had to pay after some arguing eventually they accepted it the lounge was packed staff less than helpful when i tried to get some answers on my seat reassignment i was told i would get my money back  no chance of that so dont even try the flight boarded by bus the journey took 15 minutes to get from terminal to aircraft which i am guessing was at another terminal because it took so long to get there why not board us through that terminal rather than drag us all over the airport finally got onto the plane ba staff are not friendly its no wonder they are ranked 13th i now realise its a privilege being allowed to step onto a ba flight and it departed 90 minutes late myself and many other travellers had connections and this meant i was either going to miss the connection or i would manage to make the connection but my luggage wouldnt would ba flight crew help me on board to figure out the connection they eventually came to tell me me in their haughty attitude we are now landing 15 minutes earlier so that give you a full 50 minutes to make your connection landing early does not mean getting to the gate earlier it usually takes at least 10 minutes from landing to gate then another 7 for the jetway to be attached and if you are lucky to be sitting near the door straight off if not 20 minutes to disembark if you want to be helpful dont say stupid things to people who are frequent travellers as it turned out i was sitting near the door and had to run off the plane qatar were there to assist but i did have to run from the a gates all the way to c gates to make my connection not a short distance for a 70 year old and the luggage did not make it many others were not as fortunate and didnt make their connections why put a page in the flight entertainment for connections if you are not going to provide the information its public information you can look it up on line so the aircraft has access to wifi and satellite communication so i fail to understand why this information cannot be captured and displayed i complained to ba got a wishy washy email with a number of excuses in it no mention of the seat refund i got a paltry voucher that im supposed to use on another ba flight  who are they kidding i am not sure i want to experience that again however i have recently discovered that of my frequently travelled to destinations is really only serviced by ba if i want to fly at a reasonable hour of the day or go all over europe just to avoid them which is too expensive i consider them one of the worst airlines i have ever flown and getting worse by the minute fly them only if you absolutely have to and good luck,637,0.013269927536231888,positive,-0.6973,negative,"['travelled', 'london', 'doha', 'july', 'physically', 'check',

103,we travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use ba on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays operational issues flight cancellations poor checkin experiences etc on our last two recent trips one to zurich and another to iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported we have just returned from iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with ba again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 745am we went to bed at around 11pm night before checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine we woke up at 530am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning we were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day it soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by ba was 3 days later we opted to choose tuesday with ba as we were left with no other option if we hadnt acted quickly the tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with ba in zurich back in december we were lucky on this occasion as ba offered several flights back on the same day in zurich but this wasnt the case with iceland we were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport from a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels we then decided to search for any indirect flights online to get us back to the uk sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an indirect flight into gatwick with norwegian air but it went via oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours this was not ideal as our car was in heathrow assessing our options which were virtually none we had no guarantees that the flight with ba on tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with norwegian air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of 600 if we had stayed in iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with ba or the insurance company our priority was to return home asap as we had important work and personal commitments on the monday so we had to return asap we eventually flew back fine with norwegian air and the service we received was far superior to that of ba the boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with ba norwegian air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks teas and also a range of alcoholic drinks compare this to just the water and snack bar on ba both flights were on time and we eventually landed in gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time we got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at gatwick and in

113,i should like to review my flight with british airways from hannover to london heathrow firstly the website was very easy to use however i object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating checkingin online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat at the boarding gate in hannover the staff were superb they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for checkin i was included in this the staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner the flight took off reasonably ontime the cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight the now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a uk 50p coin were issued to the passengers on this flight the captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way he oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements disembarkation was orderly however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism this experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey,256,0.22175407925407925,positive,0.9921,positive,"['like', 'review', 'flight', 'british', 'airways', 'hannover', 'london', 'heathrow', 'firstly', 'website', 'easy', 'use', 'however', 'object', 'policy', 'put', 'place', 'regards', 'pay', 'preferred', 'seating', 'checkingin', 'online', 'easy', 'process', 'presented', 'fee', 'select', 'seat', 'boarding', 'gate', 'hannover', 'staff', 'superb', 'insisted', 'people', 'larger', 'bags', 'turned', 'bags', 'checkin', 'included', 'staff', 'fair', 'polite', 'imposed', 'policy', 'evenly', 'firm', 'polite', 'manner', 'flight', 'took', 'reasonably', 'ontime', 'cabin', 'crew', 'good', 'coped', 'really', 'well', 'entirely', 'full', 'flight', 'usual', 'small', 'bottle', 'water', 'tiny', 'snack', 'size', 'uk', 'coin', 'issued', 'passengers', 'flight', 'captain', 'vocal', 'nicest', 'possible', 'way', 'oozed', 'sense', 'professionalism', 'well', 'spoken', 'clear', 'informative', 'announcements', 'disembarkation', 'orderly', 'however', 'cabin', 'crew', 'nowhere', 'seen', 'leaving', 'aircraft', 'given', 'short', 'flight', 'given', 'full', 'nature', 'flight', 'cabin', 'crew', 'deserve', 'applause', 'professionalism', 'experience', 'turned', 'around', 'less', 'positive', 'experience', 'airline', 'months', 'ago', 'well', 'done', 'ground', 'staff', 'cabin', 'crew', 'making', 'pleasant', 'civilized', 'journey']"
114,we have flown with british airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience we werent able to check in online because the system wouldnt accept any of our passport info so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport we arrived two hours before our scheduled departure the line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in we talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online it took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us we told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldnt accept our passports she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally i asked that wouldnt they verify them that way anyway i also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldnt secure them because we couldnt finish check in she went on to tell us its a full flight so we wouldnt be able to choose our seats we reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability during the flight the service was not what we expected based on previous flights we only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash every time i went to the lavatory there were at least 68 attendants standing around chatting instead of taking care of the passengers the attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt the flight attendants were disappointing to say the least no available air control vents above us so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had upon landing we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags an hour later still no bags finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the eta of the bags was still unknown about 30 minutes later the bags started to slowly appear on the belt overall this was the worst ba flight weve experienced,389,-0.05635964912280702,negative,-0.9861,negative,"['flown', 'british', 'airways', 'times', 'last', 'trip', 'far', 'worst', 'experience', 'werent', 'able', 'check', 'online', 'system', 'wouldnt', 'accept', 'passport', 'info', 'wait', 'check', 'upon', 'arrival', 'airport', 'arrived', 'two', 'hours', 'scheduled', 'departure', 'line', 'backed', 'stations', 'staffed', 'room', 'least', 'attendants', 'help', 'expedite', 'check', 'talked', 'people', 'line', 'unable', 'check', 'online', 'took', 'desk', 'attendants', 'hour', 'check', 'people', 'ahead', 'us', 'told', 'agent', 'tried', 'check', 'online', 'wouldnt', 'accept', 'passports', 'replied', 'need', 'verify', 'passport', 'personally', 'asked', 'wouldnt', 'verify', 'way', 'anyway', 'also', 'let', 'know', 'attempted', 'move', 'closer', 'front', 'plane', 'could', 'see', 'seats', 'available', 'couldnt', 'secure', 'couldnt', 'finish', 'check', 'went', 'tell', 'us', 'full', 'flight', 'wouldnt', 'able', 'choose', 'seats', 'reached', 'gate', 'ask', 'agents', 'moving', 'another', 'section', 'confirmed', 'availability', 'flight', 'service', 'expected', 'based', 'previous', 'flights', 'saw', 'flight', 'attendants', 'food', 'service', 'twice', 'pickup', 'trash', 'every', 'time', 'went', 'lavatory', 'least', 'attendants', 'standing', 'around', 'chatting', 'instead', 'taking', 'care', 'passengers', 'attendants', 'seemed', 'uninterested', 'inexperienced', 'even', 'snapping', 'confused', 'passenger', 'regarding', 'seat', 'belt', 'flight', 'attendants', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least', 'available', 'air', 'control', 'vents', 'us', 'option', 'air', 'flow', 'whole', 'plane', 'upon', 'landing', 'went', 'baggage', 'carousel', 'claim', 'bags', 'hour', 'later', 'still', 'bags', 'finally', 'message', 'came', 'loudspeakers', 'elevator', 'plane', 'broken', 'eta', 'bags', 'still', 'unknown', 'minutes', 'later', 'bags', 'started', 'slowly', 'appear', 'belt', 'overall', 'worst', 'ba', 'flight', 'weve', 'experienced']"

124,ba created a new lowcost subsidiary in ba euroflyer for flights out of london gatwick from a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from ba mainline shorthaul out of heathrow however it is most definitely inferior firstly is the seats  ba promised to keep their old much more comfortable pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats however at ba euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes despite snagging a seat in row 10 we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests one positive of the new seats was meant to be atseat power to charge devices but this didnt have that either the onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of harrogate spa water what we got was horrible nairns raisin oat biscuits without asking if wed like the other choice and no water on the return flight it was explicitly announced wed be offered a glass of water for free but this was not offered during the service the snack was sole choice of a pack of mcvities milk chocolate digestive hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings weve received when flying from heathrow on the way back we did have nonrefurbished plane with pinnacle seats this was welcome however clearly the plane is not maintained as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap  very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet i went to rinse my hand in the other toilet luckily it wasnt busy the tap was working but the sink wasnt draining and almost overflowed lastly the cabin crew on ba euroflyer are very unpolished look miserable and extremely demotivated a lot of them a very young were talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them ba really needs to rethink its product offering in shorthaul  ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons but invariably there is a reason like us they dont fly with their lowcost rivals because they want peace of mind less stress and to be comfortable so replicating the likes of ryanair easyjet or wizz air is just alienating as a customer because we choose ba to avoid the kind of experience they offer we were on an award ticket but looking at cash tickets theyre not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals despite all this

131,we booked premium economy round trip from phoenix to zurich via aa codeshare and operated by british airway on our way return flight back to phoenix february 25th the first leg of the ba flight 0773 between zurich and london heathrow was delayed departure which cause us missed the ba 0289 connection flight between heathrow and phoenix first problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 1200 pm the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 225 pm if it will be on schedule we had almost 30 min at that point however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 330 pm we were directed to the customer service to rebook the flight when we got to ba customer service transfer counter there was only one agent available there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines we were told ba was short of staffs due to british holiday during end of february and there was a soccer championship match that sunday so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to phoenix on different flight on the same day then the agent who rebooked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed we found zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well we also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel however no map or detail direction provided it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5 by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired next day we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 225 pm i noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iphones find me feature i had apple air tag in each of my checked bags so i checked with the gate agent she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight luckily the flight was delayed two hours so my other bag made to the same flight while on the flight the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant but they missed to service me meal i did not order any special meal and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row so i told her any chicken dish will be ok and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash i mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish she was surprised and acting like i was lying to her overall i think my premium economy

139,starting off at heathrow terminal 3 check in was fairly easy but fast track security was terrible the area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving ive heard mixed things about the ba club lounge but i was fairly impressed food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice nice salads as well as pie and veg drinks as always in ba lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasnt very busy at the time i went sunday evening boarding was well organised and club passengers  higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily amenity kit bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down hot towel provided after take off shortly followed by drink and nuts as has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 12 hrs after take off then a breakfast meal before landing both meals were genuinely delicious all meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked drinks were provided whenever asked although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order almost but not quite like a la carte dining crew were friendly and efficient with some nice personality coming through this is fairly standard of my experience with ba in flight entertainment was excellent good screen quality responsive touch screen excellent selection i did not use the wifi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable i think the seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough the crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means its a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other facing away from the door i did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class

176,stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to miami four of us from one family were travelling british airways business i am a british airways gold card member i have been a member of british airways executive club since 1979 we only ever fly british airways in first class or business class it has become a habit to fly ba and we do this because we trust them for safety we have regular long haul flights booked with british airways in both first and business into next year we often fly to the usa both my wife and i used to have virgin atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to ba because virgin did not have a first class seat product even so the service from virgins gold card department was off the scale absolutely brilliant and we loved the virgin lounge at heathrow our flight to miami with british airways was on one of their double decker aircraft these are just too big and i believe contributed to the appalling service perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however whether in business or first i now view ba aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky the food is not much better however our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies changing nappies within the business class cabin instead of doing it where they should be doing it in the wc try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo there must have been three or four babies having nappies changed regularly in our cabin i can put up with the screaming because that cant be helped but not poo cabin crew did nothing about it despite being asked i telephoned ba customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in manchester ba office who told me that she was ba cabin crew for many years she told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal my wife and i are flying first class british airways again to the usa in april and we also have first class tickets to the usa booked for december i sent in a complaint to ba customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled british airways on december 19 to miami from lhr and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful i received a response offering a 300 voucher or 30000 avios so given the cost of four business class flights to miami from london british airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin at 75 per passenger given that i am a gold card holder an extremely good customer clearly in the top one percent of all ba customers and a gold cardholder if that is how they behave with me god knows how they behave with everybody else all i can tell you is that flying with virgin atlantic when i was a gold member was highly positive when our children were young we used to fly ba first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin not in any cabin when i complained to british airways i asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question i have numerous business class flights booked with ba over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight

203,much better experience this time around flew cpt to lhr on a new a350 checkin was efficient i used the bidvest lounge at cpt as it is better than bas lounge boarding was speedy the new business class club suites are very good slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat 1a instead of 1k which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1a showed up we arranged a seat switch second time in a row it has happened why cant ba staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right captains announcement was short and on point welcome drink was served at the correct temperature ie cold first time ever for me  previously ba has always served the welcome champagne warm ife system was good  everything worked as it should felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi i did not bother cocktail was good the nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff  other airlines bring out something classier a female flight attendant came to take my order and i asked for rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast she repeated back to me so you want a p and a c it was such a bizarre thing to say that i misheard i thought she said so you want beef and sea confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying p for panacotta and c for chicken but how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code why not just say so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish like every other restaurant  airline does in the world the internal coding of food ordering is exactly that  internal she even looked irritated at me that i did not understand her jargon first time the food when it came was excellent much much better than recent flights i read somewhere that ba changed caterer if so it shows the panacotta was superb as was the chicken  good restaurant quality the wine was ok to good but definitely not good to excellent i feel that while the food has got better in ba business class the wines have got worse certainly compared to air france which i have also flown recently the wine was brought out on time not afer i finished eating as it was lass time i flew ba business cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time i had a good nights sleep plenty of snacks out if you wanted them and they did not run out breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot previously it has been lukewarm so all in all a vastly improved service offering the staff seemed rushed off their feet  it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats overall summary vastly improved passenger proposition it would be 1010 but i deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon

214,dear community i feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with british airways buckle up folks this ones a rollercoaster on july 16 and 17 2023 i had the displeasure of flying with british airways on ba709 and ba7 and let me tell you it was a nightmare the initial flight from zurich zrh to london lhr on ba709 faced a seemingly unavoidable onehour delay upon arrival at lhr this of course resulted in me missing my connection to tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to tokyo hnd via beijing with air china oh but the fun didnt stop there  flight ca183 was also delayed turning my 16hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours finally arriving in tokyo at 2300 instead of the promised 710 and the cherry on top my four checkedin suitcases decided to take a detour and didnt join me in tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center i finally got my lost luggage back on july 23 because why make it easy right but wait theres more my return flight from tokyo to zurich ba8 on august 8 also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for british airways the cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided tokyo tour as if that werent enough i had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expensesextra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements the lack of assistance at lhr airport was the icing on this bitter cake installing the ba app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no ba clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating british airways youve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet heres hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now its not a good look frustrated and fed up bert,363,-0.021428571428571436,negative,-0.9641,negative,"['dear', 'community', 'feel', 'compelled', 'share', 'utter', 'frustration', 'disappointment', 'defined', 'recent', 'travel', 'experience', 'british', 'airways', 'buckle', 'folks', 'ones', 'rollercoaster', 'july', 'displeasure', 'flying', 'british', 'airways', 'let', 'tell', 'nightmare', 'initial', 'flight', 'zurich', 'zrh', 'london', 'lhr', 'faced', 'seemingly', 'unavoidable', 'onehour', 'delay', 'upon', 'arrival', 'lhr', 'course', 'resulted', 'missing', 'connection', 'tokyo', 'triggering', 'automatic', 'rescheduling', 'flight', 'tokyo', 'hnd', 'via', 'beijing', 'air', 'china', 'oh', 'fun', 'didnt', 'stop', 'flight', 'also', 'delayed', 'turning', 'delay', 'grand', 'total', 'hours', 'finally', 'arriving', 'tokyo', 'instead', 'promised', 'cherry', 'top', 'four', 'checkedin', 'suitcases', 'decided', 'take', 'detour', 'didnt', 'join', 'tokyo', 'forcing', 'waste', 'additional', 'two', 'hours', 'filling', 'forms', 'baggage', 'center', 'finally', 'got', 'lost', 'luggage', 'back', 'july', 'make', 'easy', 'right', 'wait', 'theres', 'return', 'flight', 'tokyo', 'zurich', 'august', 'also', 'danced', 'delay', 'tune', 'making', 'question', 'punctuality', 'myth', 'british', 'airways', 'cumulative', 'impact', 'delays', 'torpedoed', 'vacation', 'plans', 'stealing', 'whole', 'day', 'scheduled', 'activities', 'including', 'guided', 'tokyo', 'tour', 'werent', 'enough', 'dig', 'deeper', 'pockets', 'unforeseen', 'expensesextra', 'airport', 'transfers', 'tour', 'operator', 'assistance', 'fees', 'emergency', 'purchases', 'airport', 'meals', 'international', 'calls', 'rearrangements', 'lack', 'assistance', 'lhr', 'airport', 'icing', 'bitter', 'cake', 'installing', 'ba', 'app', 'get', 'basic', 'information', 'alternative', 'connection', 'flights', 'hassle', 'fact', 'ba', 'clerk', 'could', 'provide', 'info', 'person', 'downright', 'infuriating', 'british', 'airways', 'youve', 'left', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'dent', 'wallet', 'heres', 'hoping', 'take', 'feedback', 'seriously', 'step', 'game', 'right', 'good', 'look', 'frustrated', 'fed', 'bert']"

274,british airways has a total lack of respect for its customers i was booked to fly from frankfurt main to london city airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by ba without explanation when i was already at the airport the worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers the ground staffs attitude was that they are merely third party agents not ba employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact ba directly via phone if we wanted help they couldnt even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  so ba abandoned its passengers they did tell us that the ba departure to heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further ba flight from frankfurt to london that day although other airlines were still operating the route but ba refused to rebook us on them the reason given for both cancellations was technical reasons no assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs i received an email an hour later notifying me that i had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasnt acceptable as i had to get back to london that night i rang bas call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point there was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and i had a solid phone signal and wifi as i was still standing in terminal 2 of frankfurt main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details they just dont care in the end i had to arrange my own return to london by taking a coach to hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with ryanair to stansted at least that flight operated on time and got me back to london ba is worse than a low cost carrier now,412,-0.03874999999999999,negative,-0.966,negative,"['british', 'airways', 'total', 'lack', 'respect', 'customers', 'booked', 'fly', 'frankfurt', 'main', 'london', 'city', 'airport', 'couple', 'hours', 'scheduled', 'departure', 'flight', 'suddenly', 'cancelled', 'ba', 'without', 'explanation', 'already', 'airport', 'worst', 'thing', 'utter', 'callousness', 'staff', 'showed', 'towards', 'customers', 'ground', 'staffs', 'attitude', 'merely', 'third', 'party', 'agents', 'ba', 'employees', 'therefore', 'quickly', 'washed', 'hands', 'us', 'telling', 'us', 'contact', 'ba', 'directly', 'via', 'phone', 'wanted', 'help', 'couldnt', 'even', 'provide', 'us', 'phone', 'number', 'telling', 'us', 'look', 'bacom', 'ba', 'abandoned', 'passengers', 'tell', 'us', 'ba', 'departure', 'heathrow', 'also', 'cancelled', 'meaning', 'would', 'ba', 'flight', 'frankfurt', 'london', 'day', 'although', 'airlines', 'still', 'operating', 'route', 'ba', 'refused', 'rebook', 'us', 'reason', 'given', 'cancellations', 'technical', 'reasons', 'assistance', 'information', 'provided', 'rights', 'due', 'cancellation', 'information', 'help', 'regarding', 'food', 'accommodation', 'help', 'etc', 'attitude', 'literally', 'cancellation', 'nothing', 'problem', 'received', 'email', 'hour', 'later', 'notifying', 'automatically', 'rebooked', 'alternative', 'flight', 'hours', 'later', 'wasnt', 'acceptable', 'get', 'back', 'london', 'night', 'rang', 'bas', 'call', 'centre', 'showed', 'high', 'degree', 'callousness', 'halfhour', 'call', 'spent', 'waiting', 'hold', 'phone', 'cutting', 'half', 'hour', 'meaningful', 'information', 'given', 'point', 'attempt', 'call', 'operator', 'call', 'back', 'line', 'cut', 'solid', 'phone', 'signal', 'wifi', 'still', 'standing', 'terminal', 'frankfurt', 'main', 'airport', 'even', 'though', 'phone', 'number', 'listed', 'booking', 'contact', 'details', 'dont', 'care', 'end', 'arrange', 'return', 'london', 'taking', 'coach', 'hanh', 'airport', 'away', 'waiting', 'hours', 'booking', 'expensive', 'last', 'minute', 'ticket', 'ryanair', 'stansted', 'least', 'flight', 'operated', 'time', 'got', 'back', 'london', 'ba', 'worse', 'low', 'cost', 'carrier']"

283,i arrived at the airport about 25 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in go through security etc all that went without any issues being that i was relatively early at the gate i was one of the first passengers there after some time boarding had opened first the business class got called up then families with children and disabled people a couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people one by one by name then there was an announcement they wont let anyone in anymore me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in the reason they said was that the plane was short staffed later i discovered speaking to a manager that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked after the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldnt be let in anymore nothing changed and everyone was sent away i had a connecting flight later that day that i was going to miss because i was not let on the plane first i tried to get my luggage back which i didnt receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel then just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane i wanted to talk to someone from british airways since they dont have a service center at frankfurt airport everyone went to the checkin counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyones flight nor get anyone refunded all the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund i waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation after the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the checkin counter to get a confirmation from them that i will receive a refund being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened when they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault i could not attend the flight it looked like i had missed it for everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same but the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it we are supposed to get an email at some point in the future i was not able to get a written confirmation that i will get refunded even after several times asking for it i already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way in the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which i would not know if i ever got it backed,605,0.04876925400181214,positive,-0.7449,negative,"['arrived', 'airport',

305,terrible experience with british airways i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may 10 2023 my flight was scheduled to leave at 400 pm in the afternoon i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousins place en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight so it was imperative that i got to london i checked the ba website and couldnt find any other flights with them that would work so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after 1000 pm so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation thats when they advised me that because i had requested a refund they used the phrase abandoned travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me apparently i should have called them first and then they would have made the arrangements of course they dont explain that on their website  they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email they flat out refused to budge i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip once this incident happened i ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga ie different airport than the one i had originally booked from and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldnt travel by train to my cousins place any longer 3 bags in tow and i didnt want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up this cost me another 125 in room and meal costs all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5000 free avios  a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first they wouldnt budge very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they werent the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens and that way they would never encounter this problem my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money ive been an executive club member for years and they simply didnt care they said there was nothing they could do im sure if one of the ba executives friends or family members had gone through this staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again,637,0.0025533661740558267,positive,-0.5966,negative,"['terrible', 'experience', 'british', 'airways', 'booked', 'flight', 'ba', 'travel', 'gibraltar',

376,i will never travel with british airways again i spent over 10000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing 7879 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is 170 i paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british airways,318,-0.05950980392156863,negative,-0.9844,negative,"['never', 'travel', 'british', 'airways', 'spent', 'business', 'class', 'seat', 'attend', 'funeral', 'uk', 'first', 'boeing', 'cabin', 'seats', 'across', 'aisle', 'getting', 'reality', 'premium', 'economy', 'seats', 'narrow', 'effectively', 'business', 'class', 'seat', 'cut', 'half', 'squeezed', 'seats', 'means', 'passengers', 'bump', 'heads', 'bulkhead', 'stand', 'many', 'clamber', 'others', 'go', 'toilet', 'wakes', 'passenger', 'whole', 'point', 'business', 'class', 'pay', 'rest', 'privacy', 'someone', 'push', 'top', 'second', 'food', 'disgusting', 'third', 'service', 'terrible', 'fourth', 'toilet', 'tiny', 'fifth', 'inflight', 'screen', 'fixed', 'high', 'could', 'see', 'anything', 'sixth', 'baggage', 'handling', 'also', 'appalling', 'meaning', 'taxi', 'waiting', 'hours', 'pay', 'free', 'airport', 'transfers', 'british', 'airways', 'seventh', 'charging', 'points', 'work', 'second', 'leg', 'london', 'larger', 'plane', 'seats', 'across', 'aisle', 'bearable', 'hopping', 'people', 'seat', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'piece', 'means', 'sleeping', 'metal', 'bar', 'seat', 'gap', 'seat', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'find', 'flights', 'back', 'sydney', 'small', 'plane', 'book', 'seat', 'check', 'paid', 'note', 'seats', 'left', 'got', 'worst', 'seat', 'house', 'going', 'appalling', 'airline', 'service', 'ever', 'encountered', 'point', 'paying', 'business', 'class', 'british', 'airways']"

and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the pinnacle seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour  messy illfitting uniforms and unclassy makeup toilets clean and maintained appreciate antibacterial wipes being kept available postcovid inbound dbvlgw for some reason no online or app checkin available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual checkin though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful proactively offered to take our larger handluggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason its truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilots for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcements  during the flight one couldnt even remember where we flying back to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary seats for this flight were horrendous and the new slimline ones ba are installing from row 14 onwards these seats have barely any padding so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable we landed 55 minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given  we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise wed been stranded for hours wed spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given 7 because in the context of the shorthaul market thats what they deserve  we fly ba as we dont fly the lowcost carriers after so many bad experiences but its by no measure good just the least bad option given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary

424,the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th february at 1955 this happened to be our first flight with our newborn 3 month old daughter it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence just under 3hrs before scheduled departure the original 9th february flight was cancelled we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express id booked a day of holiday off work for this trip we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead on the way back from the cancelled flight both me and my wife tried calling ba despite one of us having silver membership possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there i took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human we often received the response similar to computer says no if this is the service level for silver members i cant imagine what a regular punter has to put up with when the phone originally connected to a person i had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up  ba then proceeded to autobook us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination our original flight was to munich and the autobooked replacement flight was to salzburg when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart they couldnt understand my frustration  eventually someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 1700 not ideal as id wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldnt refund us or move our booking but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg  the day of the new flight came round and this time we managed to get all the way to the check in desk upon arriving at the check in desk we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier no email no text no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook at this point i didnt know whether to explode with anger or cry luckily another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us we were booked onto another flight later that evening 1955  ba0958 unfortunately that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so theres really no difference between the lounge and a hostel other than you get free stuff in the former this was not a pleasant experience we did eventually arrive in munich and despite asking didnt get our push chairstroller delivered to the front of the plane the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground  they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too all in all another

443,my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on 14th february 2023 i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british airways and have 26 minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you she refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to go online to rebook your seat i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport must be wrong he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the checkin line and told a checkin agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a 30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop,491,-0.04229437229437229,negative,-0.8176,negative,"['review', 'relates', 'appalling', 'experiences', 'british', 'airways', 'february', 'due', 'travel', 'madrid', 'british',

to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vielhr leg the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380 and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered online checkin in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of 2022 there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website  and did not upload any covid documentation  i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vielhr leg the shopbacom page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times  over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhrlax leg there was no premeal beverage service and there were no midflight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the prelanding snack of a ploughmans lunch being downright disgusting  there was no beverage or bar setup in the galley areas  beverages available to passengers during the flight  as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i wont comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380 as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not 6 2 long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my 6 2 height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage

474,vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec 22nd we received an email on dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost 1000 from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to checkin 15 hours before take off we found that our van  lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional 7001000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about 1000 cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for 15 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out  the customer service person would take 1520 minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience  we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling

637,very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 600 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small pieces were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25 of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is

685,overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around 2223c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a 1hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of wellpresented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdglhr leg air france presented a chic cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising  klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5 the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead its quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers  their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was 200 one way 600 return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money,311,0.22503787878787884,positive,0.9905,positive,"['overall', 'lovely', 'flight', 'ba', 'edinburgh', 'christmas', 'holidays', 'lounge', 'ok', 'quite', 'worn', 'although', 'staff', 'food', 'nice', 'much', 'better', 'travelled', 'last', 'time', 'although', 'plane', 'seemed', 'old', 'cabin', 'felt', 'fresh', 'clean', 'temperature', 'perfectly', 'adjusted', 'liking', 'around', 'funky', 'lighting', 'although', 'seats', 'economy', 'pretty', 'comfortable', 'hop', 'much', 'better', 'air', 'france', 'together', 'enhanced', 'legroom', 'row', 'wonderful', 'gold', 'card', 'passengers', 'ba', 'automatically', 'reserves', 'row', 'club', 'europe', 'enhanced', 'legroom', 'think', 'great', 'touch', 'crew', 'especially', 'purser', 'phenomenal', 'extremely', 'friendly', 'adaptive', 'needs', 'professional', 'leaving', 'pleasant', 'flight', 'aftertaste', 'afternoon', 'tea', 'catering', 'lovely', 'short', 'flight', 'sandwiches', 'scones', 'tasty', 'actually', 'fan', 'wellpresented', 'however', 'simpler', 'meals', 'board', 'opinion', 'tastier', 'give', 'feeling', 'trust', 'quick', 'hop', 'ba', 'ticked', 'marks', 'comparison', 'cdglhr', 'leg', 'air', 'france', 'presented', 'chic', 'cold', 'starter', 'however', 'looked', 'bit', 'complicated', 'except', 'duck', 'terrine', 'rather', 'unappetising', 'klm', 'served', 'super', 'nice', 'simple', 'chicken', 'caesar', 'paper', 'box', 'one', 'big', 'drawback', 'first', 'wing', 'experience', 'queue', 'long', 'decided', 'go', 'regular', 'lines', 'instead', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'given', 'much', 'money', 'regular', 'flyers', 'companies', 'spend', 'earn', 'gold', 'status', 'nevertheless', 'flight', 'importantly', 'crew', 'completely', 'negated', 'drawback', 'flight', 'one', 'way', 'return', 'incl', 'transfer', 'kirkwall', 'pretty', 'expensive', 'however', 'service', 'seemed', 'like', 'worth', 'money']"

book onto the same route that id previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves  but on a new date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight  a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight as well as them still keeping the airlines id redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and thats just how the system works however if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent  who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issues  took my card details including full card number dates and cvc code  and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow a week later i still had no ticket no details no charge to my card no booking reference  nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over 6 weeks  on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag the next day  around 48 hours before i was due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag luckily i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online the whole experience was stressful costly and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to british airways hold music furthermore there has been a significant cutback to bas inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portions leaving

personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks that cost me my 2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov 12th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march 20 i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they wont extend the voucher im even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline im not even going to bother using my second voucher and ive cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed whod have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive

starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding im not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee  shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5 she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldnt do it as my results didnt go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive ive come to her 3 times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady ive ever met unfortunately i didnt catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i cant thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i dont know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i havent met them i dont know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed

843,san diego to stockholm via london had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten but i realise this would be unfair ba is a game of two halves the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago the food in club is excellent the cabin crew attentive and professional the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers the problems start when anything goes wrong  which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on noncore routes in my case the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft an ancient 747 going technical then a comedy of errors first the hotel vouchers just said holiday inn there are about 15 in san diego cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc next the replacement flights the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me were confirmed or whatever on calling ba they wouldnt talk to me because i failed security i didnt know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my companys travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used the next day i went to take the replacement flights alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane i was pulled off minutes before takeoff ba had not paid for the flight a reservation had been created but no ticket issued ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online why was i not on this when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to exceptionally change my flight again after i

1004,hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august on 2nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves on 3rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on 4th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th how come it would disappear on the 5th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you cant imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage thats how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our

1037,johannesburg to cape town return this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape towns domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with madetoorder drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6 as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra 7 per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a 2x3 configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a downtoearth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplaneboard but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737 it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africas busiest air route for the price paid id be happy to fly them

1225,newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy world traveler plus i paid about 40 more for premium economy about 600 extra so approximately 150 per leg was it worth it id say broadly yes though i wouldnt want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 67 hours was involved before boarding premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 and india to uscanada is one of those exceptions though it isnt clear if it applies for travel originating at either end so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the 2 bag allowance boarding you board in zone 3 after firstbusiness  the oneworld elites that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage  if it doesnt fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding this means you also get off fairly quickly  which can help if youre in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight there is a welcome drink for premium economy champagne juice water depending on the departure time there is also a hot towel service also 787 cabin the 7879 has a nicely done premium economy cabin 232 seating as opposed to 333 in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats  but seat was comfortable the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage though not much there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades socks and toothpaste the seat back screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy  so not a long walk 777 cabin 777 has a 242 seating in premium economy same as club world as opposed to 333 in economy the 777 version used on the lhrblr sector has a very small premium economy cabin  just 3 rows of seats this gives it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full  and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs that helped me stretch out for sure the seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats food nothing much here i didnt think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been it was ok  nothing to write home about all in all for such a long journey the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and

maybe another bottle of water they asked me to fill out what i would like for breakfast on a card i filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came the vacation itself was great on the day of the return flight our trenitalia train broke down in naples and we were 80 mins late my wife tried dozens of times to phone british airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service we tried the numbers from our tickets their website their help desk facebook page google etc we tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins and could not get through my wife managed to check herself in online but could not check me in there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in once my wife pressed my name the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete it was a computer glitch we couldnt get around  ultimately we arrived at the rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in my wife was ok and could go through but i could not we asked the 3 ladies at the british airways desk for help and they shrugged and said they couldnt help us apparently they said it would have been different if we called before and we showed them her phone see the attached photos with all the calls we made they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldnt reschedule us they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior so i was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs she was managing all the luggage the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed the attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way the new secret customer service phone number we were given did work and my wife was on the phone with customer service for over an hour after reviewing the details with several teams of specialists we were told basically that they didnt believe us that we tried to call they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call nothing could be done for us and they could only rebook us for 8800 no apologies whatsoever were given nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in rome we eventually made it home on different airlines but i have lost all respect and trust for

1330,toronto to lhr and lgw to toronto return in wt finally ba has moved back into its own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture however premium plaza still staff and operate the lounge food was ok  but the drinks choices remain poor slick boarding and a full pe cabin on a 777 water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights to london apparently 3 are loaded in london for the ow leg but none for the return friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul salty dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables the salad is a nonsense  a few leaves and a tomato slice pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross got a couple of hours sleep however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working a reset halfway through the flight worked though two loud renditions of delibes flower duet burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up the standard tcs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is ba should be embarrassed that its even offered after leaving toronto 5 mins late we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags for the return leg i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security  even in the fast track lane gatwick airport sell 5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food and champagne available as a help yourself efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew a fast offering of champagne with a top up before take off though the old safety video was still showing the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow  more experienced faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service fast bar service once airborne followed by the old biz food service overcooked steak again alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option plenty of wine and drinks along with tc after a pleasant 3 hour nap i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream  off the menu due to supply issues at the gate early and fast bags too this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu i hope gatwick catches up so ba dont unintentionally promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative on the ow leg premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp the food is truly awful  both dinner and breakfast and it really wouldnt take much to add better food bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat all that said i felt that ba is regaining its mojo with great crew improved on board experience cuts reinstated and on time performance long

1336,amman to london appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service we are strict vegans so prebooked vegan meals for our flight meals were delivered as usual and had the vegan slip on them but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter  this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was informing me that there was no meat in it i had to explain to her what a vegan was ie no dairy or eggs it turns out that the so called vegan meal had milk and egg in it needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals shortly after they came around with the drinkstrolley so we asked for a coffee with soya milk  the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said oh i dont think we have that but we have semi skimmed milk i had to reexplain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask when she returned she said we dont provide that sort of thing that was strange because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did so we had no meals no hot drinks and our video screen did not work the customer service that followed from was more appalling they could not care less it took ages to get replies and when i did i was just palmed off after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper which was just another way of getting rid of us so we did this after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation  basically the value of the meals that we could not eat  in vouchers,325,-0.08611111111111111,negative,-0.985,negative,"['amman', 'london', 'appalling', 'service', 'flight', 'subsequent', 'customer', 'service', 'strict', 'vegans', 'prebooked', 'vegan', 'meals', 'flight', 'meals', 'delivered', 'usual', 'vegan', 'slip', 'start', 'eating', 'noticed', 'given', 'butter', 'made', 'doubt', 'authenticity', 'meal', 'called', 'staff', 'idea', 'vegan', 'informing', 'meat', 'explain', 'vegan', 'ie', 'dairy', 'eggs', 'turns', 'called', 'vegan', 'meal', 'milk', 'egg', 'needless', 'say', 'eat', 'meals', 'vegan', 'meals', 'shortly', 'came', 'around', 'drinkstrolley', 'asked', 'coffee', 'soya', 'milk', 'staff', 'explain', 'vegan', 'said', 'oh', 'dont', 'think', 'semi', 'skimmed', 'milk', 'reexplain', 'vegan', 'milk', 'said', 'would', 'go', 'ask', 'returned', 'said', 'dont', 'provide', 'sort', 'thing', 'strange', 'weeks', 'ago', 'outbound', 'journey', 'meals', 'hot', 'drinks', 'video', 'screen', 'work', 'customer', 'service', 'followed', 'appalling', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'took', 'ages', 'get', 'replies', 'palmed', 'several', 'months', 'write', 'emails', 'informed', 'submit', 'everything', 'letter', 'needed', 'paper', 'another', 'way', 'getting', 'rid', 'us', 'several', 'weeks', 'offered', 'us', 'pathetic', 'compensation', 'basically', 'value', 'meals', 'could', 'eat', 'vouchers']"

this from london despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere we boarded just about on time around 1930 only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so shortly after we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut and no planes were taking off about an hour into the ordeal we were told that the airspace had reopened but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot one more hour in we were told airspace was shut again after 3 hours good news  or so we thought  we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later we did then leave the gate and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived so our flight wad cancelled we taxied back to the gate where we waited a further 1015 minutes for ground staff to become available i must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat and the cabin crew were very good the crew gave us the inflight service minus alcohol so we were well fed and watered this is the full extent of my praise though little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come bas ground handling was attrocious we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings however ba had cancelled around 7 flights and the queues were very lengthy vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because all the rooms were full i have never heard anything like it this is beyond unbelievable no assistance for children elderly and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers as is the norm in this situation further the promised rebooking staff had all gone home  i was told to consult the ba app the following morning bas app has rebooked my flights  two days later when my trip was for three days total the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights so i can replan my trip for another weekend is broken i guess ill be trying out their call centre in the morning this is all simply appalling we all understand that adverse weather happens but to keep us on a plane for 4 hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on moreover ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to 24hour airports i do not know and as for the ground handling i have never had an experience this bad ba staff themselves were thin on the ground  they left most of the work to heathrow staff who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the we dont work for ba excuse ive had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review because they genuinely couldnt have handled it better by contrast i dont see how ba could have handled this worse they really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days

1410,london heathrow to mahon booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults 2 children and 1 infant in lap almost 1k for all of us prebooked seats at the same time i was rather surprised when i got an email two weeks out saying about your flight to madrid on the 26th may when i was flying direct heathrow to menorca airline assured me everything was fine further concern when selfservice checkin opened 24 hours out wife and daughters checked in fine me and my son were referred to airport checkin despite all being on the same booking an urgent call to ba i was told 1 i was probably being moved to a bassinet position when i pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2 infants cant check in online which i now understand is also incorrect my concern was well placed at ba t5 bag drop check in agent looked flustered a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes only after i checked them she sheepishly admitted that our prebooked seats were gone my son and i had no seats at all and were standby and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin 16 rows apart prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know after kicking up a huge fuss i believe they cant legally sit children below a certain age away from parents the checkin manager offered me no explanation other than full flights but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight fast forward to the gate  utter carnage including the checkin supervisor who cant have been more than 22 in tears when i eventually got seen i was finally given a seat number for me and my son again many rows apart from the rest of my family as this was my sons first ever flight i was absolutely livid that we couldnt sit anywhere near each other added to that my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding kids needing toilet etc i put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness we boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore  holding my son i get to my assigned seat and someone is in it asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat cue ba staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff i even heard one of them mutter check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that were going to have to get off here and my children in tears much checking of ipads and a ba staff member is then found there were quite a few on the flight apparently and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight what seat raised a formal complaint and was told that they understand my frustration which is nice separate complaint raised to caa about a

1416,singapore to london this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a380 now this aircraft in qantas colours is one i am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with qf as mentioned in my review of ba16 which was the first leg of this trip it is the on board soft product that is the problem the same comments for that review apply here the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content on qantas american cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies great music choices those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning godfather gladiator braveheart roman holiday etc are all things we as passengers want to see some smart edgy team in soho london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff ife is one thing on long haul the other is food and beverage the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly on qantas say qf1 from singapore to london one gets the evening meal service followed by weiss ice cream a lindt chocolate along the way midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found chocolates banana bread cheese and biscuits you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between the a380 is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes put the smartest best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls one guy looked like steptoe for those who remember and was a miserable flying on an a380 should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another that is sad given the stature of ba i came back on ba31 from london to hong kong and the same comments apply hard product is fine except for no snack bar but the soft product is lacking severely,445,0.08513613579403055,positive,0.943,positive,"['singapore', 'london', 'second', 'part', 'sydney', 'london', 'trip', 'looked', 'forward', 'ba', 'aircraft', 'qantas', 'colours', 'one', 'familiar', 'flown', 'around', 'sectors', 'last', 'months', 'qf', 'mentioned', 'review', 'first', 'leg', 'trip', 'board', 'soft', 'product', 'problem', 'comments', 'review', 'apply', 'ife', 'work', 'mystery', 'terms', 'content', 'qantas', 'american', 'cathay', 'one', 'gets', 'really', 'good', 'mix', 'old', 'new', 'movies', 'great', 'music', 'choices', 'compile', 'content', 'need', 'look', 'mean', 'award', 'winning', 'godfather', 'gladiator', 'braveheart', 'roman', 'holiday', 'etc', 'things', 'passengers', 'want', 'see', 'smart', 'edgy', 'team', 'soho', 'london', 'pulled', 'content', 'together', 'forgetting', 'everyone', 'edgy', 'want', 'see', 'cutting', 'edge', 'stuff', 'ife', 'one', 'thing', 'long', 'haul', 'food', 'beverage', 'food', 'quality', 'substandard', 'something', 'read', 'constantly', 'qantas', 'say', 'singapore', 'london', 'one', 'gets', 'evening', 'meal', 'service', 'followed', 'weiss', 'ice', 'cream', 'lindt', 'chocolate', 'along', 'way', 'midnight', 'snack', 'pizza', 'sandwich', 'morning', 'breakfast', 'fruit', 'eggs', 'usual', 'muffin', 'etc', 'rear', 'main', 'deck', 'snack', 'bar', 'galley', 'found', 'chocolates', 'banana', 'bread', 'cheese', 'biscuits', 'would', 'need', 'really', 'hungry', 'get', 'lot', 'point', 'available', 'offered', 'ba', 'need', 'get', 'away', 'meal', 'service', 'take', 'landing', 'nothing', 'flagship', 'aircraft', 'qantas', 'treated', 'qantas', 'fanboy', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'planes', 'put', 'smartest', 'best', 'looking', 'crew', 'onto', 'flagship', 'people', 'remember', 'ba', 'crew', 'certain', 'vintage', 'suited', 'lawn', 'bowls', 'one', 'guy', 'looked', 'like', 'steptoe', 'remember', 'miserable', 'flying', 'experience', 'enjoy', 'trips', 'aircraft', 'ba', 'managed', 'reduce', 'large', 'low', 'cost', 'aircraft', 'moving', 'people', 'one', 'point', 'another', 'sad', 'given', 'stature', 'ba', 'came', 'back', 'london', 'hong', 'kong', 'comments', 'apply', 'hard', 'product', 'fine', 'except', 'snack', 'bar', 'soft', 'product', 'lacking', 'severely']"
1417,sydney to london via singapore it has been a very long time since i was on a long haul with ba of more than 9 hours last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in 2002 the years have not been kind to ba probably a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airlines nearly all my long haul is with qantas on its a380 occasionally emirates on its version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airlines the problem is not the hard product a b777 or the a380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame the b777 from sydney to singapore was fine nosier than the a380 but that is well known very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call sydney home it is the soft product that is lacking check in was fine and despite being in economy had an express pass through security being a gold ff with qantas boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore now its just a lack of polish with the soft product no menu given showing what was to be served as with cathay emirates and qantas the cutlery was really cheap and i mean cheap kfc offers a better grade of plastic i know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at ba needs to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas the food itself was very bland a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert its just the quality that is lacking drinks i have a tradition something silly about starting a journey off with a jack daniels and coke this is available on qantas but no sir we dont serve that a note about the fas they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver final word about this leg is the ife a touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years one or two interesting things and some new releases come on ba for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics as for music well im 53 but still like the pearl jams etc of the world we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenters if ba is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline it is a mix of ba going back and

window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as i got printed boarding pass concorde room was nice well designed but quite crowded in some places had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace before it got served a good 20 minutes later checkout out the cabana for an hour which was not very appealing at all and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment i booked for the spa onboard was informed there was a problem with the seat i had selected and was issued a new aisle seat which was disappointing upon entering the first class cabin i had a quick look at the seat and it was not immediately apparent there was something wrong i asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that i will indeed not be able to sit there but there was no explanation of what was wrong given i did not want to waste any time to settle in the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private with a small wardrobe to hang jacket the tv screen seemed quite large and high quality unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive and neither was the remote for the tv soon after take off i was informed i could eat when i like arabic starter was great had preselected main meal online meal was of good quality and cooked well had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate not as good as other cheese ive had in some business class surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection i imagine on two ultralong flights in the same month one might run out of anything of interest to watch after finishing the one film i decided to watch i decided to try get some sleep crew made the bedding while i tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough i missed breakfast as i was still rather full from the dinner and predinner at the lounge overall i was reasonably happy with the flight and the product the crew were very friendly and professional given this was first class have to admit there was no wow factor either with the soft product or ground experience i managed to book flights for a good price during a promo otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short

being served drinks all choices were available but the food is just not club standard poor entrees cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly  how long does the new pilot service to new york have to last for got some sleep had an okay fast breakfast passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new first check in fast track and concorde lounge excellent service on boarding a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food all choices available some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea dry sandwiches with mean fillings but okay cakes and scones early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags 45 mins after landing these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experiences the crew were young and lacking experience  knowledge but make an enthusiastic polite and smart however they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service long haul crew were cranky at times but they

1575,vancouver to edinburgh via london was the worst travel experience i have had i was travelling with 2 seniors 85  70 we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving we actually had to beg for help the distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors in our way from london to edinburgh it was a nightmare the flight was delayed and we got to london about an hour late on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care the 2 seniors had to walk all that way it was not only the walking it was the rush they had as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 130 hours on our way back from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate again we had to beg for assistance and the british airways staff did not seem to know or care about this they said that they called the buggy and that was all we said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all we were lucky i asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 in london and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point this gentleman who is not british airways employee provided a great service summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help us out seats were another problem we did the online check in 24 before and we had the seats already chosen 12d for one senior isle and 18d isle for the other senior when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats so once again more walking for them problems to get inout the seats and of course problem to get to the washroom  luggage another problem british airways in inverness said that the luggage goes directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver surprise surprise we went through customs and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage  they said we had to pick it up before going through customs there was no way to go back to the carousel so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage so nightmare again and another rush to us to get to the next fligh according to westhet agents they said that british airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection what can you expect from british airways if it doesnt even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in

1595,bangkok to london heathrow despite all the negative reviews i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe on this route ba has a daylight flight i cant stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you cant sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service the fare was also pretty good in the end i have to admit my mates were right this was a let down all along my issues were the following i purchased a ticket in premium economy the advertised seats on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version when in fact not one of the 777200 which operates the lhrbkklhr route have been refitted the seat date from the early 2000s  almost two decades ago and i had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat come on  yes i got my amenities kit a better pillow british papers and predepartures drinks a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus but the seat is old not that comfy the ife belongs to the late 90s and is a disgrace to the industry great sound good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality i spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as i could not see squat the seat itself is way outdated and the cabinseat were dirty it was however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great the meal service was not good out of bkk bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack  just a napkin main dish was ok but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke no cheese nor crackers not enough at all you are left starving and in economy it is even worst i have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the jc had a brand new a la carte service as well  cabin crew operating both legs were great  professional approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks out of lhr the main meal was this time pretty good including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert the only false note was the meal preselection you get served first as they do with special meals  but do not offer you any drinks you have to wait for a very long time by then my meal was cold and i sent it back they did replace it right away but this was clearly a waste of time preselecting your meal means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak pax with special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway other than that it was this time a decent meal having

1598,tel aviv to london we arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take the stories were true although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc there were limited priority options available for first class passengers although i suspect that is more down to the airport than british airways the lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first and isnt really acceptable if it was just business then it would be fine i guess but there is not very much seating the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another very complicated machine with all instructions only in hebrew at the gate there was the usual priority boarding queue as well as the regular queue but the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all oneworld emerald sapphire and ruby members  which is a lot of people whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members there really should be another queue for first and oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long the service on board didnt start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew i got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front i had to go to the galley and ask they were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldnt happen in first the seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing which limits how much you can watch it was the thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch the food and drinks on board were all excellent including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well aside from the hiccup at the beginning the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special it would have been nice to have been referred to by name which i have had before on ba and with other airlines even in business class on arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew let down only by the ground service in israel i used avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for

1599,london to tel aviv arrived at heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy but check and security felt like it was 10pm very easy and quick process which included regular rather than fast track security as we didnt follow the signs properly we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor although they did later improve the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches soup and some dry cake this wasnt really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty drinks overall were good as always with british airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling in terms of seating there was enough for all the passengers in there and it was quite busy and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place although better variety in seating including some more comfortable chairs would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges smiles are free and go a long way and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality eerily walking around slightly like a zombie seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice there arent really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin this meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access these seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort privacy and access unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution selection and even the fact that some screens wont even stay in place and fold themselves away british airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft end of story even the thales system is showing its age now but this rockwell collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience food and drinks on board were actually quite good although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet overall it was a very enjoyable flight and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money having said that i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash,587,0.1658580705009276,positive,0.999,positive,"['london', 'tel', 'aviv',

1615, verified review   london to santiago cabin crew generally helpful and friendly cabin a bit grubby crumbs nuts and grime in evidence on the flight home as i took my seat i saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight  evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough the alcoholic drinks were all pleasant the food was of variable quality as was the coffee none bad some a bit mediocre some good many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and i found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another sleeping passengers legs trying not to wake them up the other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you cant watch it as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you on both flights i found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that i would have to look at it at an angle i solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit but then i had to take it out every time i got out of my seat another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer and that adds to the litter problem after you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin what do you do with it er drop it on the floor i did manage to sleep quite well though the pillow you are provided with is very thin on the flight back they gave me another one when i asked another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket sweater or whatever the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer and i dont want to seem a bit picky but although the inflight entertainment has a good choice of films the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating they are all divided into categories such as comedy thrillers etc but no az all in all it wasnt an unpleasant experience but i would advise ba if they were interested in my advice that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and rethink the seat configuration,457,0.023553921568627453,positive,0.2045,positive,"['verified', 'review', 'london', 'santiago', 'cabin', 'crew', 'generally', 'helpful', 'friendly', 'cabin', 'bit', 'grubby', 'crumbs', 'nuts', 'grime', 'evidence', 'flight', 'home', 'took', 'seat', 'saw', 'bit', 'wrapper', 'ear', 'plugs', 'give', 'seemed', 'left', 'previous', 'flight', 'evidence', 'whoever', 'wields', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'passengers', 'board', 'needs', 'bit', 'thorough', 'alcoholic', 'drinks', 'pleasant', 'food', 'variable', 'quality', 'coffee', 'none', 'bad', 'bit', 'mediocre', 'good', 'many', 'commented', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'seat', 'arrangement', 'found', 'bit', 'palaver', 'carefully', 'step', 'another', 'sleeping', 'passengers', 'legs', 'trying', 'wake', 'problem', 'configuration', 'video', 'screen', 'stowed', 'take', 'landing', 'means', 'cant', 'watch', 'economy', 'screen', 'back', 'seat', 'front', 'flights', 'found', 'screen', 'seemed', 'broken', 'would', 'lock', 'position', 'would', 'look', 'angle', 'solved', 'problem', 'stuffing', 'rolled', 'magazine', 'hinge', 'bit', 'take', 'every', 'time', 'got', 'seat', 'another', 'problem', 'configuration', 'storage', 'space', 'minimal', 'apart', 'overhead', 'lockers', 'small', 'drawer', 'adds', 'litter', 'problem', 'taken', 'polythene', 'wrappers', 'headphones', 'blanket', 'paper', 'ring', 'around', 'napkin', 'er', 'drop', 'floor', 'manage', 'sleep', 'quite', 'well', 'though', 'pillow', 'provided', 'thin', 'flight', 'back', 'gave', 'another', 'one', 'asked', 'another', 'small', 'problem', 'individual', 'air', 'conditioning', 'vent', 'seat', 'take', 'jacket', 'sweater', 'whatever', 'lack', 'storage', 'space', 'means', 'go', 'overhead', 'locker', 'already', 'filled', 'little', 'drawer', 'dont', 'want', 'seem', 'bit', 'picky', 'although', 'inflight', 'entertainment', 'good', 'choice', 'films', 'menu', 'system', 'seeing', 'bit', 'irritating', 'divided', 'categories', 'comedy', 'thrillers', 'etc', 'az', 'wasnt', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'would', 'advise', 'ba', 'interested', 'advice', 'need', 'clean', 'planes', 'often', 'thoroughly', 'rethink', 'seat', 'configuration']"

our flights scheduled departure at 1100 am on the evening of october 16 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 700 am in the morning on october 17 the captain announced that the chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock after these announcements we frantically tried to contact british airways because we expected that we would miss our 1100 am flight we were unable to do so we were informed that in order to exit china without a visa we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country we were aware of this requirement we had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane we knew that without a visa of valid flights out we would be escorted to the local chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country for obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation we were able to contact a travel agent via email our phone was not operating as we were at sea in chin  our agent was able to contact british airways and explain our situation there was another flight that departed on october 18 which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight that was flt ba 160 we were told here are your choices 1 pay a change fee of 884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights ba 160 and ba 2167  even though we would be able to make ba 2167 as it did not depart london lgw until 1155 am on october 18 2017 2 pay an additional 6388 per person for a total of 12776 to keep our business class status on both flights we had already paid 1032826 for these tickets 3 disembark the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration option 2 was outrageous option 3 frightening we felt we had no choice but to choose option 1 the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at checkin and request our business class seats if they were available when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available yes several was the response we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats yes for a cost of 12776  of course we refused to pay that amount we were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy while on board during that flight ba160 i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats were we on the same flight as originally scheduled but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers apparently british airways sold our seats or an upgrade to

1634, verified review   gatwick to marrakech generally a well organised flight and fairly full in y class my gripe is about the current food service this was a fairly long shorthaul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable after a lot of comments from others who have flown ba recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the cohoice on board is very limited especially as much seems to be already sold out the biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling it took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though i observed that about 60 of passengers bought nothing of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which i assume was not welcomed by those passengers i overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time it is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long i remember the days when a british midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a lhr to middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an aer lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from dublin to london if ba want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it,296,0.12235449735449734,positive,-0.2551,negative,"['verified', 'review', 'gatwick', 'marrakech', 'generally', 'well', 'organised', 'flight', 'fairly', 'full', 'class', 'gripe', 'current', 'food', 'service', 'fairly', 'long', 'shorthaul', 'flight', 'scheduled', 'reasonable', 'meal', 'service', 'would', 'welcome', 'desirable', 'lot', 'comments', 'others', 'flown', 'ba', 'recently', 'bought', 'food', 'terminal', 'departure', 'cohoice', 'board', 'limited', 'especially', 'much', 'seems', 'already', 'sold', 'biggest', 'issue', 'time', 'taken', 'food', 'selling', 'took', 'almost', 'flight', 'time', 'crew', 'work', 'plane', 'serve', 'every', 'row', 'even', 'though', 'observed', 'passengers', 'bought', 'nothing', 'course', 'led', 'problems', 'wishing', 'go', 'toilets', 'rear', 'food', 'service', 'starts', 'front', 'passengers', 'front', 'middle', 'access', 'aft', 'toilets', 'trolley', 'passed', 'passengers', 'resorted', 'using', 'forward', 'toilets', 'passing', 'business', 'class', 'assume', 'welcomed', 'passengers', 'overheard', 'crew', 'member', 'saying', 'going', 'duty', 'free', 'sales', 'time', 'ridiculous', 'paid', 'limited', 'service', 'takes', 'long', 'remember', 'days', 'british', 'midland', 'crew', 'could', 'serve', 'full', 'cooked', 'breakfast', 'tea', 'coffee', 'pax', 'lhr', 'middlesbrough', 'flight', 'scheduled', 'minutes', 'aer', 'lingus', 'crew', 'serving', 'hot', 'breakfast', 'turbulent', 'flight', 'hr', 'dublin', 'london', 'ba', 'want', 'differentiate', 'low', 'cost', 'carriers', 'way']"

1653, verified review   gatwick to orlando return worst ever longhaul business class flight  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended not the worlds favourite airline by far we have never liked bas business class club world seats since they changed over to the yinyang layout of 8 seats across the cabin the seat layout together with the poor service meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever longhaul business class flight we have experienced to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place unless you are sat in an aisle seat cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinksmeals which is just ridiculous true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head in order to get out of the centre seats rows e and f and the window seats you have to climb over another passengers feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly often from behind you so by the time you notice them they have gone we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service the return leg was a night flight the service overall was very poor the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap the service at breakfast was also poor the offerings were inconsistent my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee the entertainment system was archaic very few recent film titles the small screen resolution was very poor this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service it will be marginally better than being seated at the back but that does not make it right we will probably never fly ba longhaul business class club world again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and reconfigure

minus the chicken and noodle the lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away efficient boarding with sparking winesoft drinks offered early departure fast drink service and dinner before lights out there was no breakfast previously scrapped with the cereal bar now also gone early arrival a short wait for a shower in the north lounge followed by an ok breakfast an early departure and an average flight on a a319 long queues for the bathroom only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink early arrival though a long wait for bags oslo to london on a a320 was verging on a farce a full flight selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space the buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life broke out the paper visa slips took the cart back in reappeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases the crew tried really hard put a brave face on and kept going the organisation and concept of the ba buy on board is a disgrace though a third party provides the food and card machines the choice stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce  i dont understand why ba continue to struggle with this service as easyjet ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together early arrival and fast bags completed the flight final flight home to toronto was good the club lounge at the b gates remains quiet clean and an oasis to relax and eatdrink before flying the 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time at the gate the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class service was really slow on boarding i had to ask for champagne and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off we pushed back over 30 late no signs of life from crew for another 30 mins though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart the main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking no dried gravy or potato around the edges afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic overall the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements the crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience the desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times other than the farce of buy on board i was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in

1673, verified review   port of spain to gatwick via st lucia was a good experience i dont have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks the seat was comfortable enough a bit wider than on low cost flights i had extra space and as i noticed the leg room between seats was regular i had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room there was a minor issue the flight had a stop at st lucia after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row opened their entertainment system screens to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from port of spain i told them its not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time so this would be something the management should look into inflight entertainment was good with no advertising which pleased me a lot i had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat sometimes talked louder than necessary but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers there were minor issues during checkin at the departure airport in port of spain the ba staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as i have a gold card on oneworld to use the lounge i had to use my priority pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff i was flying further from gatwick to istanbul on turkish airlines hoping i would not have to change airports in london and as a result go through immigration take the baggage out checkin again pass immigration and security again but ba doesnt have an agreement with turkish airlines and i had to go through this lengthy process,366,0.13682323232323232,positive,0.9875,positive,"['verified', 'review', 'port', 'spain', 'gatwick', 'via', 'st', 'lucia', 'good', 'experience', 'dont', 'complaints', 'regarding', 'seat', 'quality', 'flight', 'attendants', 'good', 'job', 'flight', 'keeping', 'passengers', 'safe', 'serving', 'meals', 'drinks', 'seat', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'bit', 'wider', 'low', 'cost', 'flights', 'extra', 'space', 'noticed', 'leg', 'room', 'seats', 'regular', 'seat', 'behind', 'bulkhead', 'enough', 'leg', 'room', 'minor', 'issue', 'flight', 'stop', 'st', 'lucia', 'new', 'flight', 'attendants', 'insisted', 'waking', 'people', 'front', 'row', 'opened', 'entertainment', 'system', 'screens', 'show', 'safety', 'video', 'shown', 'hour', 'half', 'take', 'port', 'spain', 'told', 'necessary', 'view', 'video', 'actually', 'video', 'available', 'time', 'would', 'something', 'management', 'look', 'inflight', 'entertainment', 'good', 'advertising', 'pleased', 'lot', 'jolly', 'passenger', 'next', 'middle', 'seat', 'bit', 'much', 'drink', 'moved', 'lot', 'seat', 'sometimes', 'talked', 'louder', 'necessary', 'still', 'fun', 'around', 'flight', 'attendants', 'made', 'sure', 'polite', 'funny', 'way', 'disturb', 'passengers', 'minor', 'issues', 'checkin', 'departure', 'airport', 'port', 'spain', 'ba', 'staff', 'forgot', 'put', 'priority', 'tag', 'bag', 'give', 'voucher', 'lounge', 'gold', 'card', 'oneworld', 'use', 'lounge', 'use', 'priority', 'pass', 'waste', 'time', 'matter', 'cleared', 'ground', 'staff', 'flying', 'gatwick', 'istanbul', 'turkish', 'airlines', 'hoping', 'would', 'change', 'airports', 'london', 'result', 'go', 'immigration', 'take', 'baggage', 'checkin', 'pass', 'immigration', 'security', 'ba', 'doesnt', 'agreement', 'turkish', 'airlines', 'go', 'lengthy', 'process']"

1680, verified review   i flew from london heathrow to sofia and back the plane on both flights was an airbus 321 and id guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior i am 182m 6 feet tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine  i certainly didnt feel cramped even in the centre seat both flights departed the gate on schedule although actual takeoff on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over europe the cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous on both flights the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress so far top marks to british airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service it might seem like a minor gripe but i do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if i have to pay for it which you do not on other legacy airlines like lufthansa the range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines i have flown with but there the comparison ends because whilst i have always been served quickly and sometimes twice on short haul lowcost airlines bas service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too they also insist on card only transactions i had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs  and the a321 is a long plane a single trolley started from the front making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long i only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories the coffee by the way was excellent the return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley leaving the remaining passengers unserved in conclusion clean plane punctual service pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service,376,0.06804988662131524,positive,0.9735,positive,"['verified', 'review', 'flew', 'london', 'heathrow', 'sofia', 'back', 'plane', 'flights', 'airbus', 'id', 'guess', 'young', 'one', 'judging', 'freshness', 'interior', 'feet', 'tall', 'found', 'leg', 'room', 'seat', 'width', 'fine', 'certainly', 'didnt', 'feel', 'cramped', 'even', 'centre', 'seat', 'flights', 'departed', 'gate', 'schedule', 'although', 'actual', 'takeoff', 'outbound', 'flight', 'slightly', 'delayed', 'air', 'traffic', 'restrictions', 'europe', 'cabin', 'crew', 'legs', 'pleasant', 'courteous', 'flights', 'captain', 'kept', 'us', 'well', 'informed', 'route', 'progress', 'far', 'top', 'marks', 'british', 'airways', 'let', 'shambles', 'refreshment', 'service', 'might', 'seem', 'like', 'minor', 'gripe', 'like', 'opportunity', 'get', 'something', 'eat', 'drink', 'flight', 'even', 'pay', 'legacy', 'airlines', 'like', 'lufthansa', 'range', 'prices', 'food', 'drink', 'offer', 'comparable', 'low', 'cost', 'airlines', 'flown', 'comparison', 'ends', 'whilst', 'always', 'served', 'quickly', 'sometimes', 'twice', 'short', 'haul', 'lowcost', 'airlines', 'bas', 'service', 'slow', 'seems', 'run', 'stock', 'also', 'insist', 'card', 'transactions', 'misfortune', 'sitting', 'toward', 'rear', 'plane', 'legs', 'long', 'plane', 'single', 'trolley', 'started', 'front', 'making', 'ponderous', 'progress', 'towards', 'even', 'though', 'flight', 'two', 'hours', 'forty', 'minutes', 'long', 'managed', 'get', 'coffee', 'sandwich', 'slightly', 'harried', 'flight', 'attendant', 'returned', 'trolley', 'scuttling', 'galley', 'squeezing', 'past', 'long', 'queue', 'passengers', 'waiting', 'lavatories', 'coffee', 'way', 'excellent', 'return', 'flight', 'worse', 'trolley', 'made', 'two', 'thirds', 'aisle', 'getting', 'tantalisingly', 'close', 'abruptly', 'stopping', 'returning', 'galley', 'leaving', 'remaining', 'passengers', 'unserved', 'conclusion', 'clean', 'plane', 'punctual', 'service', 'pleasant', 'cabin', 'crew', 'awful', 'refreshment', 'service']"

1692, verified review   london gatwick to funchal in my opinion british airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom for travellers in economy ba are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that they have failed to understand what their true market is all about generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of ryanair or easyjet the ba brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides but sadly not any more the choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but its expensive frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay and that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left on our flights to and from funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink maybe thats in the next part of the ba master plan british airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier simply lost somewhere in the middle as a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away dont ba management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for free food and drink sadly i think we know the answer all we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete,355,0.0575110187915066,positive,-0.2615,negative,"['verified', 'review', 'london', 'gatwick', 'funchal', 'opinion', 'british', 'airways', 'got', 'things', 'badly', 'wrong', 'race', 'bottom', 'travellers', 'economy', 'ba', 'another', 'budget', 'carrier', 'good', 'one', 'failed', 'understand', 'true', 'market', 'generally', 'people', 'want', 'use', 'cheap', 'budget', 'carrier', 'use', 'likes', 'ryanair', 'easyjet', 'ba', 'brand', 'always', 'associated', 'quality', 'full', 'service', 'airline', 'provides', 'sadly', 'choice', 'food', 'sale', 'economy', 'passenger', 'poor', 'expensive', 'frankly', 'must', 'embarrassing', 'cabin', 'crew', 'make', 'announcements', 'saying', 'business', 'class', 'passengers', 'offered', 'hot', 'meal', 'free', 'drinks', 'economy', 'must', 'pay', 'assumes', 'enormous', 'range', 'types', 'sandwich', 'offer', 'left', 'flights', 'funchal', 'single', 'trolley', 'entire', 'economy', 'cabin', 'case', 'taking', 'hours', 'make', 'front', 'back', 'service', 'could', 'slower', 'crew', 'trying', 'sell', 'scratch', 'cards', 'along', 'overpriced', 'food', 'drink', 'maybe', 'thats', 'next', 'part', 'ba', 'master', 'plan', 'british', 'airways', 'used', 'national', 'carrier', 'proud', 'days', 'embarrassment', 'full', 'service', 'airline', 'decent', 'budget', 'carrier', 'simply', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'fairly', 'regular', 'traveller', 'many', 'years', 'preference', 'would', 'always', 'travel', 'national', 'airline', 'race', 'bottom', 'driving', 'away', 'dont', 'ba', 'management', 'understand', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'gladly', 'pay', 'little', 'bit', 'free', 'food', 'drink', 'sadly', 'think', 'know', 'answer', 'need', 'bugle', 'playing', 'plane', 'touches', 'sad', 'transition', 'world', 'class', 'carrier', 'poor', 'budget', 'imitator', 'complete']"

1700, verified review   on a flight from bangkok to london and youll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of thailand in their meal choices first meal service has thai green curry veg and the second thai red curry chicken really no one could come up with two thai dishes that were a little bit more different so the meal service begins and i was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns  i said i dont want the prawns for starter as im having the prawn main meal i should not have worried as the prawn salad was off  ok so prawns for starter and ill have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce mashed potatoes mushroom spinach and tomato well im not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point i wasnt eating them the chicken breast was dry and i got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it mushrooms were very meh tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible the bread roll didnt win any prizes either i just gave up and refused to eat it now when this was served id been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the fa was off too quickly no problem press the call bell which is reset before anyone comes press it again and think id better get on with eating my food eventually some one arrives and notices im not eating my main course and after i tell them it is disgusting i ask why no one has answered my call button obviously im just asked what did i want and i say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and ill have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice this does not appear for fifteen minutes during that time i am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isnt going work for me so a couple of hours later im a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where i find some quite pleasant snacks back at my seat i think i need a gt with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin there is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger cw cabin i do find one in the second galley i ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times ive tried to use it and been ignored bad service now on to the second meal service strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu i ask the fa about this but am just told everyone is having the same no explanation the starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing the dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now i have to choose again ok main meal im give a choice of smoked salmon again or red thai curry so no choice really and i decide to give up and go to a restaurant when i disembark just not recommended at

1721, verified review   toulouse to london heathrow this airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier it has to be said no expense is spared on its branding while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management i have bronze status with ba executive club have flown a dozen times over the past year both in business and in economy and am increasingly irritated with myself that i chose to collect points with this particular airline i was caught up in the it meltdown in may flying from rhodes to london and i was one of the lucky ones who doesnt remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days i had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled along with hundreds of other ba flights in may this incidentally ghastly tui replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight i booked that i lost my prepaid hotel booking at the airport which the airline refused to refund when i lodged a claim the airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight along with eu compensation after i sent a second email a month after my first claim as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me according to the customer agent their customer service is beyond atrocious i suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for ba failings all you get is bear with us were trying really hard lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability i am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to belfast and after two calls to their contact center based in india with a poor connection and amateur communication overall still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a canadian citizen without a uk id document the customer agents i spoke to gave me contradictory answers which in turn run contrary to the almost nonexistent information provided on their website on the flights i have booked which have actually taken place i have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in bdx when the plane lost its takeoff spot having waited for delayed passengers would they admit this was their fault nope it was all air traffic controls fault been held on the tarmac in tls for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my club seat no apology from the flight

1722, verified review   london city to dusseldorf return flights operated on behalf of ba by eastern airways the cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases cabin crew must of been members of the basil fawlty school of catering the outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us the young stewardess took our orders then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal the meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented on arrival at dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal the arrivals boards in the airport say terminal b and we were dropped off at terminal c our delivered to terminal c and we had to walk to terminal b if you were been met the return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that ba is becoming famous for at overseas airports check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to lcy and 2 hours before the flight to lhr i can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at dusseldorf as the flight to lcy may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before the check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on club europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle which looked totally out of place in uniform the flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called ham  chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has wizz and ryanair in fact they have better staff than eastern airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process  i was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed on arrival at lcy it become apparent that the ground handling agents at dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind the handling agents at lcy could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight i did phone on monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system this morning i spoke to a member of senior management at dussledorf airport about 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport they will be put on the late flight tonight which means i will get it nearly 4 days after it became missed it is a pity that we cant review the ground handling

1742, verified review   san diego to london heathrow the worst business class i have flown in i flew on the 777 so whilst its not the newest plane in the fleet i still expected some level of comfort the seats are too narrow and do not lie flat im a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat there is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed but does not line up with the rest of the seat so your feet are raised the armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around every time the person next to you moves your chair moves too the hydraulics must be connected it was very annoying the tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest it sloped down and so drinksmeal tray did not stay put it was not secure and basically was flimsy and unusable i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap i was in seat 14a which was a rear facing window seat there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you which is a forward facing aisle seat the divider has to stay down until you are airbourne so for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face very awkward the tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldnt stay put it wanted to go back into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle the food well the fillet streak was tough and dry i had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with american airlines and they did a much better job the selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice service if you want good service dont get a window seat you are cut off from the aisle and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger the cabin crew forget you are even there i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round both with dinner and breakfast the layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head not ideal with some turbulence there was also no wifi even though ba advertise as such apparently the boeing 777 does not have the right equipment in short ba have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin the layout is impractical seats are narrow there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored the 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly the tvs stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal i for one will not be flying ba business again,528,-0.04184832451499119,negative,-0.7038,negative,"['verified', 'review', 'san', 'diego',

1768, verified review   naples to gatwick i used to admire and love ba i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it i think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years have complained and received some avios in compensation but this time the cup overfloweth unfortunately not with blessings we had once again  been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wifes preference states that she likes a window seat  and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other  but why does ba have to keep doing this the trip as such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks food and magazines when time came for boarding and amongst others club europe passengers were invited to board first there was no check made at all which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished once boarded we were  unlike the other club europe passengers  not offered a glass of water but worst of all and unforgivable found food debris and other dirt in between our seats so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished when i opened my meal tray it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it we took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess who seemed utterly appalled when she looked the meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle it means one gets only a smallish glassful so has to ask for a refill something not everybody likes to do this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a costcutting exercise on previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for club europe passengers are available in airports like corfu rhodes heraklion even seville contrary to bas website at the time  we were told at all these airports  ba no longer pays for its passengers to have access so this time my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in naples she was told no but at least we knew beforehand  or so we thought but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening we were joined by some rather merry club europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge though not exclusively for ba use that they had been able to access and enjoy why could the checkin staff not have told us the waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some however when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side club europe passengers were amongst the first to be called so that did not look too bad know what we showed our boarding pass then had to stand no seats available in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened in other words we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers,622,0.02659586940836942,positive,0.8875,positive,"['verified', 'review', 'naples', 'gatwick', 'used', 'admire', 'love', 'ba', 'longer', 'admire', 'dislike', 'soon',

1810, verified review   this was my first flight from toronto to london crewed by mixed fleet easy checkin at toronto pearson the ba ground staff are always great in toronto with fast track meant i was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport the lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited average wine list still too few bathrooms the seats are tatty and when busy is not a relaxing place to be easy boarding and the first of a few improvements  prosecco now served to london used to be only ex london fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer an ok chicken curry was served but i still dont see it as biz class food a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each that is where the improvements ended the morning offering of a cereal bar and tcs  juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience the crew on this flight were great young junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi but appeared in glass without asking as soon as the crew were released  classy and well remembered the return flight was less good drinks served promptly after take off and my prebooked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray crew members first flight since qualifying it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and tc customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back really as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate service reduced  yes price reduced  no the 777s in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp the ife screens are tiny mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort however the male crew were more aloof lacked attention to detail and officious what these newer crews miss was the more informal  laid back service of long haul crew  i hope they relax into the role soon at least the cuts have stopped not much left to cut i admit and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened however the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us  canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world  it really depends on what ba do next  to either value me as a customer and offer a quality service or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline at

1844, verified review   i am shocked about how the first class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were limited to cut a long story short this meant that my partner who was the last to be served was told what was available rather than asked what he would like this is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin for breakfast prior to landing we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served the presentation of the food that was available was poor  certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba uses for its first class catering we spoke to the cabin services manager who was extremely apologetic  confirmed that there has been cost cutting  apparently at the behest of the new ceo who comes from low cost sister airline vueling with a resultant increase in unhappiness  complaints from passengers the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone  other cost cutting around on board service is very evident  even the rose in the first class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba has become i fly regularly long haul with klm  their new business class offering is now far superior to bas first how can our national airline with whom we should be proud to fly compete with other superior european  gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers the cabin services manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 may almost a month later although immediately acknowledged ba have not responded probably due to more administrative cost cutting i should add that the ground service at heathrow t5  the concorde room were very good but as regards on board service ba offends their premium passengers like this at their peril,363,0.11571204657411557,positive,-0.8543,negative,"['verified', 'review', 'shocked', 'first', 'class', 'board', 'service', 'deteriorated', 'evident', 'cost', 'cutting', 'supposed', 'national', 'flag', 'carrier', 'flight', 'tokyo', 'narita', 'london', 'heathrow', 'advised', 'cabin', 'crew', 'soon', 'take', 'catering', 'supplies', 'loaded', 'limited', 'cut', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'meant', 'partner', 'last', 'served', 'told', 'available', 'rather', 'asked', 'would', 'like', 'spite', 'passengers', 'seat', 'cabin', 'breakfast', 'prior', 'landing', 'informed', 'two', 'cooked', 'breakfasts', 'available', 'would', 'first', 'come', 'first', 'served', 'presentation', 'food', 'available', 'poor', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'fine', 'dining', 'description', 'ba', 'uses', 'first', 'class', 'catering', 'spoke', 'cabin', 'services', 'manager', 'extremely', 'apologetic', 'confirmed', 'cost', 'cutting', 'apparently', 'behest', 'new', 'ceo', 'comes', 'low', 'cost', 'sister', 'airline', 'vueling', 'resultant', 'increase', 'unhappiness', 'complaints', 'passengers', 'famous', 'first', 'class', 'tasting', 'menu', 'enjoyed', 'previous', 'flights', 'gone', 'cost', 'cutting', 'around', 'board', 'service', 'evident', 'even', 'rose', 'first', 'class', 'toilet', 'dead', 'really', 'epitomises', 'lacklustre', 'airline', 'ba', 'become', 'fly', 'regularly', 'long', 'haul', 'klm', 'new', 'business', 'class', 'offering', 'far', 'superior', 'bas', 'first', 'national', 'airline', 'proud', 'fly', 'compete', 'superior', 'european', 'gulf', 'carriers', 'emphasis', 'seems', 'never', 'ending', 'cost', 'cutting', 'affects', 'even', 'premium', 'passengers', 'cabin', 'services', 'manager', 'entered', 'formal', 'complaint', 'behalf', 'board', 'may', 'almost', 'month', 'later', 'although', 'immediately', 'acknowledged', 'ba', 'responded', 'probably', 'due', 'administrative', 'cost', 'cutting', 'add', 'ground', 'service', 'heathrow', 'concorde', 'room', 'good', 'regards', 'board', 'service', 'ba', 'offends', 'premium', 'passengers', 'like', 'peril']"

1847, verified review   choose a budget airline the magic of our national carrier has gone we have always chosen british airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now its on par or lower than other low cost carriers firstly we didnt get any priority boarding with our two young children easyjet provides this secondly we reserved seats as travelling with our two children they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows on boarding we were told the plane has changed therefore we now had assigned seats thirdly after paying over 10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo first class was out of bounds so the only option the rear of the plane however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many  so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and 40 but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof asked the crew  cabin crew seats for landing the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with that landing all minor points but they were the points we enjoyed with ba points that made us choose them small points that made the difference the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them the cabin crew that always went over and beyond the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get id rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline gutted our british airways national carrier has become a budget airline perhaps cost savings are needed but for now although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead for me their usp was their service without that there is no longer a point,498,0.12150297619047622,positive,0.9818,positive,"['verified', 'review', 'choose', 'budget', 'airline', 'magic', 'national',

1848, verified review   london heathrow to seoul return i booked my return flights back in january when ba were having their annual sale for around 1700 thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around 3000 london to seoul flight was very pleasant didnt get to use the business class lounge in heathrow as my connection from manchester was delayed by 40 minutes cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of highquality menu choices the seat layout of 232 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped the seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some however there is a folddown seatstep in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully im 60 and found i was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that ive flown business class with before the only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and i found it difficult to sleep because of this seoul to london was what really let ba down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in korea in the days leading up to the flight bas massive it failure and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant i was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight the flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so takeoff was delayed by 30 minutes i had a connecting flight to catch to manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as i had just over an hour after landing to make it the flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job the pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled however due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park this meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free this was time i could not afford to lose we eventually disembarked at 1445 which meant i had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim really wish i hadnt as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the plane by the time i had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 1515 and the gate was closing in 10 mins talked to ba customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the iom where i live from london city but they could only book me on the 1450pm flight the next day wasnt at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay over 3000 when not on sale it really wasnt worth the hassle for me

1881, verified review   gatwick to antigua this was our first time in quite a while travelling from the south terminal and the first impression was that the ba check in area was a little cramped it was quite busy at the cw check in with about five couples in front of us but as there were four desks open we were through in about five minutes the fast track security was quiet and we were soon in the new lounge this is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views comfortable seats and reasonable food i had a small bacon roll and a very strange omelette roll the departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time it didnt really matter we had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the 24 hour check in as this would have cost up to 340 for my wife and i depending where you wanted to sit however we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anyway after boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine which for a change was pleasantly chilled the staff were generally friendly especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul trip once airborne we were offered two drinks with nuts before lunch and then more drinks with lunch we had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were getting although the quality was just ok i ordered a chicken curry which was rather bland the interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambience also the ife seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution afternoon tea was ok although no provision was made for my wifes sandwiches she is a vegetarian so we had to mix and match between the two of us we landed on time in antigua overall the flight was enjoyable without ever achieving any great heights pardon the pun and importantly with a good cabin crew we were able to enjoy the experience,387,0.16220805617147085,positive,0.9934,positive,"['verified', 'review', 'gatwick', 'antigua', 'first', 'time', 'quite', 'travelling', 'south', 'terminal', 'first', 'impression', 'ba', 'check', 'area', 'little', 'cramped', 'quite', 'busy', 'cw', 'check', 'five', 'couples', 'front', 'us', 'four', 'desks', 'open', 'five', 'minutes', 'fast', 'track', 'security', 'quiet', 'soon', 'new', 'lounge', 'huge', 'improvement', 'predecessor', 'north', 'terminal', 'nice', 'views', 'comfortable', 'seats', 'reasonable', 'food', 'small', 'bacon', 'roll', 'strange', 'omelette', 'roll', 'departure', 'gate', 'quite', 'cramped', 'enough', 'seating', 'passengers', 'flight', 'time', 'didnt', 'really', 'matter', 'made', 'decision', 'time', 'ago', 'pay', 'additional', 'cost', 'select', 'seats', 'prior', 'hour', 'check', 'would', 'cost', 'wife', 'depending', 'wanted', 'sit', 'however', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'seats', 'allocated', 'would', 'probably', 'chosen', 'anyway', 'boarding', 'offered', 'glass', 'sparkling', 'wine', 'change', 'pleasantly', 'chilled', 'staff', 'generally', 'friendly', 'especially', 'young', 'guy', 'said', 'first', 'long', 'haul', 'trip', 'airborne', 'offered', 'two', 'drinks', 'nuts', 'lunch', 'drinks', 'lunch', 'pre', 'ordered', 'food', 'knew', 'getting', 'although', 'quality', 'ok', 'ordered', 'chicken', 'curry', 'rather', 'bland', 'interior', 'plane', 'rather', 'showing', 'age', 'stains', 'carpet', 'overall', 'drab', 'ambience', 'also', 'ife', 'seems', 'getting', 'worse', 'unusually', 'wife', 'found', 'difficult', 'watch', 'film', 'due', 'poor', 'resolution', 'afternoon', 'tea', 'ok', 'although', 'provision', 'made', 'wifes', 'sandwiches', 'vegetarian', 'mix', 'match', 'two', 'us', 'landed', 'time', 'antigua', 'overall', 'flight', 'enjoyable', 'without', 'ever', 'achieving', 'great', 'heights', 'pardon', 'pun', 'importantly', 'good', 'cabin', 'crew', 'able', 'enjoy', 'experience']"

1916, verified review   bangkok to london heathrow boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all the flight was packed full the inflight entertainment system didnt work for the entire flight  this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours i have noticed that ba dont seem to care about ife not working on ba0009 and ba0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers the captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasnt the cabin crews fault they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction he explained that the system had overheated  well that calms things i do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous ba0009 flight i never want to experience again so i was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available however i was told they had been withdrawn  i was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry i managed but remembered how well eva air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals the cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them i have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern ie blocking doors i also experienced sinus problems pain and congestion which is i believe due to the air quality on boeing 777 airplanes the air being very dry with little humidity i do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches sinus pain and congestion i only experience this after flying on 777s and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems the captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable i complained to ba and also emailed ceo alex cruze having been urged to do so by the crew my email to the ceo was forwarded to customer services no surprises there customer services who replied quickly investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks i was advised that the lack of ife would be investigated by their maintenance team they would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but i didnt expect them to by way of compensation i was given 3000 avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where avios are accepted frankly i am disappointed in both the flight and bas level of compensation i have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route the only way to check is to fly that route again with ba do i risk it  therefore i will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane

1957, verified review  no no no british airways youve messed up someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights just like many other airlines do and they said lets provide food from ms that will make our offering classier than the rest the problem on my 1855 flight from marrakech to london was that  it being dinner time  loads of passengers wanted food and drink so the service was inevitably snailpaced a piece of friendly advice ba you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight or you merely annoy your customers sitting near the back of the plane my wife and i got served 2 hours into the 35 hour flight by which time our tongues were hanging out but whats this only two sandwiches left and we bagged the last two packets of crisps youre promising things you cant deliver ba there is such as thing as advertising standards and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards the 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someones payment card failed to register on their machine hint for frequent flyers if your card just doesnt work you get your food and drink for free meanwhile behind the service trolley a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves a very appropriate expression in the circumstances other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and ms extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare the process i call ryanisation of british airways is almost complete you now charge for checked baggage yes i know thats indirect but only idiots cant see through the scam you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats and now youve devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on short haul what even ba used to call medium haul flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane oh and by the way why dont the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress too costly perhaps i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan but with a minor revision british airways the worlds least favourite

1958, verified review  having only flown easyjet  ryanair for all my shorthaul journeys over the last 10 years or so i was pleased to see a relatively lowcost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome in hindsight i wish id booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement i expected at the very least an equivalent service to that of other lowcost shorthaul airlines certainly not worse narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm regardless of this there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable even on a 25hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that at a relatively small 58 my knees were grazing the seat in front lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of ms supplied food i am more than happy to pay for this on a shorthaul flight and dont expect anything for free it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions sadly being sat in row 22 this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything no sandwiches no fruit salad no yoghurt i asked what they did have their response bottle of water or a kit kat after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least they never give us enough food its mad they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the lowcost carriers sadly they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list id say id give their longhaul a chance but after this experience i wont bother what a shame,338,0.015719235544816922,positive,0.9596,positive,"['verified', 'review', 'flown', 'easyjet', 'ryanair', 'shorthaul', 'journeys', 'last', 'years', 'pleased', 'see', 'relatively', 'lowcost', 'ba', 'flight', 'round', 'trip', 'london', 'rome', 'hindsight', 'wish', 'id', 'booked', 'different', 'airline', 'booked', 'ba', 'based', 'legacy', 'reputation', 'say', 'disappointing', 'experience', 'would', 'understatement', 'expected', 'least', 'equivalent', 'service', 'lowcost', 'shorthaul', 'airlines', 'certainly', 'worse', 'narrow', 'seats', 'expected', 'seemed', 'far', 'narrow', 'norm', 'regardless', 'excuse', 'seat', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'trip', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'coupled', 'fact', 'relatively', 'small', 'knees', 'grazing', 'seat', 'front', 'lucky', 'seats', 'recline', 'feature', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'also', 'tantalised', 'ba', 'bragging', 'ms', 'supplied', 'food', 'happy', 'pay', 'shorthaul', 'flight', 'dont', 'expect', 'anything', 'free', 'certainly', 'looked', 'delicious', 'pictures', 'descriptions', 'sadly', 'sat', 'row', 'meant', 'frustratingly', 'slow', 'pace', 'cabin', 'crew', 'finally', 'getting', 'meant', 'run', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'sandwiches', 'fruit', 'salad', 'yoghurt', 'asked', 'response', 'bottle', 'water', 'kit', 'kat', 'asking', 'cabin', 'crew', 'little', 'option', 'response', 'surprising', 'say', 'least', 'never', 'give', 'us', 'enough', 'food', 'mad', 'give', 'us', 'sandwiches', 'whole', 'flight', 'needless', 'say', 'ba', 'longer', 'live', 'past', 'reputation', 'opportunity', 'position', 'best', 'lowcost', 'carriers', 'sadly', 'probably', 'sit', 'list', 'id', 'say', 'id', 'give', 'longhaul', 'chance', 'experience', 'wont', 'bother', 'shame']"
1959, unverified   london heathrow to munich return it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore the loss of the free barfood service on european flights is a real step down even worse is the cynical way in which it happened downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an improvement to offer paidfor ms food on board oh and how replacing my free drink with the same drink only now i have to pay is an improvement in service is beyond me not even a free tea or bottle of water i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying only to find it tasted of chlorine  wouldnt recommend you do the same the cardonly payment system is chaos as well it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance not wishing to pay this by the time i checked in for this flight the maximum 24 hours in advance there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane which is far from my first choice of seat other carriers let you select seats at checkin for free and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance and if you pick one of the preferred seats with easyjet you also get priority checkin and boarding for your money  not so with ba checkin at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first checkin machine wouldnt work at all and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldnt let me print a bag tag so i couldnt use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the checkin desks wasting time there was a minor delay due to fog but that wasnt bas fault and didnt have a hige impact flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good on the way back our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real pro to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares  the ability to switch between flights for free ontheday could we no the earlier flight was full rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon we rebooked on lufthansa instead in summary if flying ba on european routes these days be aware that ba is now a nofrills carrier lower your expectations to this level and youll probably have a pleasant flight,466,0.08769841269841269,positive,0.9393,positive,"['unverified', 'london', 'heathrow', 'munich', 'return', 'used', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'flying', 'ba', 'sadly', 'cutbacks', 'kicking', 'travelling', 'ba', 'feels', 'like', 'bit', 'chore', 'loss', 'free', 'barfood', 'service', 'european', 'flights', 'real', 'step', 'even', 'worse', 'cynical', 'way', 'happened', 'downgrading', 'food', 'offering', 'much', 'seemed', 'like', 'improvement', 'offer', 'paidfor', 'ms', 'food', 'board', 'oh', 'replacing', 'free', 'drink', 'drink', 'pay', 'improvement', 'service', 'beyond', 'even', 'free', 'tea', 'bottle', 'water', 'asked', 'tap', 'water', 'flight', 'earlier', 'year', 'avoid', 'paying', 'find', 'tasted', 'chlorine', 'wouldnt', 'recommend', 'cardonly', 'payment', 'system', 'chaos', 'well', 'takes', 'forever', 'trolley', 'get', 'one', 'end', 'plane', 'next', 'list', 'outrageous', 'prices', 'ba', 'charge', 'select', 'seat', 'advance', 'wishing', 'pay', 'time', 'checked', 'flight', 'maximum', 'hours', 'advance', 'seats', 'whole', 'plane', 'could', 'choose', 'took', 'sole', 'window', 'seat', 'available', 'right', 'back', 'plane', 'far', 'first', 'choice', 'seat', 'carriers', 'let', 'select', 'seats', 'checkin', 'free', 'easyjet', 'charge', 'half', 'ba', 'charge', 'select', 'equivalent', 'seats', 'advance', 'pick', 'one', 'preferred', 'seats', 'easyjet', 'also', 'get', 'priority', 'checkin', 'boarding', 'money', 'ba', 'checkin', 'also', 'hassle', 'occasion', 'first', 'checkin', 'machine', 'wouldnt', 'work', 'second', 'printed', 'boarding', 'pass', 'wouldnt', 'let', 'print', 'bag', 'tag', 'couldnt', 'use', 'bag', 'drop', 'counters', 'queue', 'checkin', 'desks', 'wasting', 'time', 'minor', 'delay', 'due', 'fog', 'wasnt', 'bas', 'fault', 'didnt', 'hige', 'impact', 'flight', 'pretty', 'smooth', 'cabin', 'crew', 'good', 'way', 'back', 'business', 'meeting', 'finished', 'early', 'tried', 'take', 'advantage', 'one', 'remaining', 'real', 'pro', 'flying', 'ba', 'europe', 'standard', 'economy', 'fares', 'ability', 'switch', 'flights', 'free', 'ontheday', 'could', 'earlier', 'flight', 'full', 'rather', 'sit', 'munich', 'airport', 'afternoon', 'rebooked', 'lufthansa', 'instead', 'summary', 'flying', 'ba', 'european', 'routes', 'days', 'aware', 'ba', 'nofrills', 'carrier', 'lower', 'expectations', 'level', 'youll', 'probably', 'pleasant', 'flight']"

1974, verified review   toronto to berlin via london on miles in a mix of classes first class check in at toronto was good with friendly staff a fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins unfortunately first lounge was full of gold card members and so had to sit in the biz lounge good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2a excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew a weird but tasty starter of a cured  dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked good cheeses and all courses selected were available after some decent sleep a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight t5 north lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty decent breakfast selection of hot rolls fruit cereals etc quick board for the flight to berlin ridiculous leg room at 30 inches max very cramped dont like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed an ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions on time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg returning to london in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever including low cost airlines a full a321 was cramped insufficient bins with one out of service and the now infamous terrible leg roomi understand this is to get even worse when ba moves to 180 pax on an a320 in line with charter and low cost carriers slow food and drink service with little take up some couldnt buy as no cash accepted not even juice water and coffee offered for free this penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the us and canadian carriers look high class the only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver the whole plane looked fed up subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish final leg to toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service poor lunch of roast chicken weird mash and overcooked greens not biz class food and pretty average more like economy food afternoon tea was fine with a fast deplaning and bags on the long haul legs the ife was identical to christmas poor choice little new material  clearly even the ife is now down graded the biz class product  once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy how the mighty have fallen experiencing four classes on four legs showed the gulf in all classes between ba and competitors on both short and long haul the short haul legs to  from berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what youre getting and its reflected in the fare and extras with less leg room fewer toilets reduced quality andor no refreshments and a general downgrading of service the only thing not reduced is the price this suggests that the ba exec and iag only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline the only thing left to strip customers of is the exec club and avios its only a matter of time

1999, verified review   hyderabad to london i have travelled ba numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when i was returning from hyderabad to london from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin while the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem the manner in which the ba staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing i have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles in this instance with british airways i was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me when i asked if i could be put on another comparable flight i was shut down and told no this is not possible without any explanation when i then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline i was told again and again no this is not possible after realising that british airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation i asked what could be done given the circumstances my answer was a to be handed a 75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing i could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service ticket class i had purchased after the flight i filed a claim with british airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience but i have yet receive even one response only adding to my understanding that british airways does not value myself as a customer or my business i am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline,354,0.018648148148148136,positive,-0.9416,negative,"['verified', 'review', 'hyderabad', 'london', 'travelled', 'ba', 'numerous', 'times', 'good', 'experiences', 'past', 'week', 'returning', 'hyderabad', 'london', 'business', 'trip', 'downgraded', 'cabin', 'downgrade', 'much', 'problem', 'manner', 'ba', 'staff', 'handled', 'situation', 'apparent', 'lack', 'care', 'effort', 'exuded', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'previous', 'experiences', 'inconvenienced', 'changes', 'cabin', 'fair', 'cancelled', 'flights', 'airlines', 'instances', 'airlines', 'fantastic', 'job', 'providing', 'alternatives', 'compensation', 'troubles', 'instance', 'british', 'airways', 'surprised', 'find', 'company', 'whole', 'seemed', 'care', 'well', 'inconvenience', 'put', 'upon', 'asked', 'could', 'put', 'another', 'comparable', 'flight', 'shut', 'told', 'possible', 'without', 'explanation', 'inquired', 'switching', 'partner', 'airline', 'receiving', 'refund', 'book', 'different', 'flight', 'another', 'airline', 'told', 'possible', 'realising', 'british', 'airways', 'way', 'going', 'try', 'remedy', 'situation', 'asked', 'could', 'done', 'given', 'circumstances', 'answer', 'handed', 'gift', 'card', 'told', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'could', 'airline', 'legal', 'obligation', 'provide', 'service', 'ticket', 'class', 'purchased', 'flight', 'filed', 'claim', 'british', 'airways', 'sent', 'emails', 'customer', 'service', 'team', 'hoping', 'someone', 'would', 'decency', 'try', 'provide', 'sort', 'remedy', 'less', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'yet', 'receive', 'even', 'one', 'response', 'adding', 'understanding', 'british', 'airways', 'value', 'customer', 'business', 'sad', 'say', 'painfully', 'bad', 'service', 'likely', 'prevent', 'booking', 'future', 'travel', 'airline']"
